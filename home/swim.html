      <p class="c-Document">
        Since the age of seven, I&rsquo;ve began swimming and fell in love with the
        sport. I even started coaching when I was eighteen. Throughout my swimming career I&rsquo;ve
        attended many swim camps and regional and state competitions. I love coaching and making
        connections between coaching, psychology, and teaching.
      </p>
      <p class="c-Document">
        My coaching philosophy highlights four priorities: Safety, Sportsmanship, Spread, and
        Success. Aside from swimmers&rsquo; safety, I support friendly competition within my team and
        among other teams. Development is also important during a single season, and I am proud of
        the many swimmers who have dropped time and gotten personal bests under my tutelage.
