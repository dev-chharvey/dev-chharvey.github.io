<p class="c-Document">Since the age of seven, I&rsquo;ve began swimming and fell in love with the
  sport. I even started coaching when I was eighteen. Throughout my swimming career I&rsquo;ve
  attended many swim camps and regional and state competitions. I love coaching and making
  connections between coaching, psychology, and teaching.</p>
<p class="c-Document">My coaching philosophy highlights four priorities: Safety, Sportsmanship, Spread, and
  Success. Aside from swimmers&rsquo; safety, I support friendly competition within my team and
  among other teams. Development is also very important during a single season, and I am proud of
  the many swimmers who have dropped time and gotten personal bests under my tutelage.</p>
<!-- <p class="c-Document">One of the most frequent duties as a coach is to construct effective
  workouts. A workout is an agenda of things to complete during one practice. My workouts always
  include a warmup, a main set, and a warmdown. The main set of a workout can take many forms, but
  I usually like to have an <i>entr&eacute;e</i> and then a few <i>side dishes</i>
  to accompany it. Another form is to have a theme for the overall main set, broken up into
  sections. For example, we may do the same type of thing for different strokes.</p> -->
