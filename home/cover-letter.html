position at
Acme, Inc.
in the
Washington, DC
area.</p><p>My experience with HTML and CSS is primarily self-taught, but I am a fast
learner and have used it to build projects using current best practices.
At my most recent position, I worked with JavaScript/jQuery, D3.js, and SVG
to build a feature that displays analytics data to users in an interactive
graphical way. I also have some experience with XML/Schema and Java.
I pride myself on architecting code that is clean, powerful, efficient,
and scalable.</p><p>I believe I can sharpen these skills to build better websites and applications,
and I can offer fresh ideas for new projects. As an avid user of Git and GitHub,
and as an occasional contributor to open-source projects, I make a great team
member and work well in a collaborative environment. I have also spent two years
teaching secondary-school mathematics, from which I have gained a bit of
leadership experience.</p><p>After graduating from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mathematics
and a Master&rsquo;s degree in Education, I taught in secondary schools for two years.
The skills I have gained from that experience would be applicable to the
position for which I am applying.</p><ul><li>Working in a classroom taught me patience, delegation, multi-tasking, and the
importance of human relationships. I believe these skills are essential in a
workplace that puts a high premium on a team-like environment.</li><li>Teaching often-complicated mathematical concepts gave me much experience
communicating complex material to an audience not well-versed in the subject
matter. I would need to draw on this skill when briefing nontechnical customers
or users.</li><li>Preparing lesson plans required me to analyze and compare different sources of
content, organize learning objectives effectively, and use data from assessments
to drive instruction. These skills would be required on a daily basis while
analyzing the technical requirements of a project or solutions to a problem.</li></ul><p>I think I have a lot to offer and can become a great asset to the
Acme, Inc.
team.</p><footer><p>Sincerely,</p><address itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Christopher&nbsp;</span><abbr title="Hewitt">H.&nbsp;</abbr><span itemprop="familyName">Harvey</span></span><br><span itemprop="address" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/PostalAddress"><span itemprop="streetAddress">11156 Byrd Drive</span><br><span itemprop="addressLocality">Fairfax, </span><abbr title="Virginia" itemprop="addressRegion">VA </abbr><span itemprop="postalCode">22030</span></span><br><a rel="author" href="tel:+17035072467" itemprop="telephone">(703) 507-2467</a><br><a rel="author" href="mailto:chrisharvey2pi@gmail.com" itemprop="email">chrisharvey2pi@gmail.com</a><br><a rel="author" href="https://chharvey.github.io/" itemprop="url">chharvey.github.io</a></p></address></footer></main><nav class="Bc" hidden=""><ol class="Anc"><li><a class="Crumb" rel="top parent" href="../index.html">Home</a></li></ol><ul class="Sib"><li><a class="Crumb" rel="sibling" href="resume.html">Resume</a></li><li><a class="Crumb" rel="this" href="cover-letter.html">Cover Letter</a></li></ul><ul class="Child"></ul></nav><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js" integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML,https://chharvey.github.io/chhlib/mathjax-localconfig.js"></script></body></html>
