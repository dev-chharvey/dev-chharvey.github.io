        I did not realize I wanted to teach secondary school math until about
        halfway through college. Leadership skills are qualities that I never knew I had until I
        started examining my academic career, and I am constantly preparing myself for becoming a
        better teacher. I love the feeling of insight (the sudden realization of a solution) and
        I&rsquo;ve discovered that I get a satisfaction from seeing others gain insight too. I want
        to make a huge difference in this world&mdash;and I believe I can&mdash;by educating the
        leaders of our future.
      p.c-Document.
        My educational interests include reading and learning about how learners solve
        problems and make decisions, think analytically and rigorously, construct their own
        mathematical understanding, and truly appreciate the value of mathematics. I&rsquo;m great
        with kids and I enjoy watching the learning process unfold. My biggest goal as a math
        teacher is to motivate students to develop their mathematical abilities and to see the
        relevance of mathematics in a society with ever-increasing emphases on science, technology,
        and engineering.
      p.c-Document.
        I believe that meaningful learning requires an engaging and interactive
        environment. Cooperation, collaboration, conversation, and competition are key to
        effective student learning. In the classroom, information and knowledge will flow in many
        directions around the room among teacher, student, and environment. Students are encouraged
        to offer their background knowledge, experiences, cultures, beliefs, values, and opinions
        to a mathematical learning community.
