<p>The music of Kent Holliday, like most contemporary music written in the Modern Era, transgresses traditional harmony. Holliday experiments with dissonance and rhythmic complexity. His music generally seems to lack tonal centers and metered bars, which is not unusual for 20<span class="superscript">th</span> Century composers.</p>
<p><cite>Four Evocations</cite> is a piece of four short movements that depicts contrasting feelings and emotions of a mountain climber, rather than providing us with concrete visual images and sights. There are barely any melodic lines in this piece: most of the music is created by the rhythm of tones and chords. In a sense, this piece is more <i>vertical</i> than <i>horizontal</i>.</p>
<p><cite>Tango Ex&oacute;tico</cite> starts off slowly and mysteriously but quickly jumps into a fast-pace, odd-metered piece. The melody is elaborately decorated with ornaments, and with an exciting bass <i lang="it">ostinato</i>. The piece frequently changes between these two moods. It ends with a comical ping on a low note.</p>
<p><cite>Recuerdos Peruanos</cite> consists of five movements attributed to ancient Peruvian mythology and culture. <cite>Cusco</cite> is a short tango-like piece in simple meter. <cite>Sacsayhuaman</cite> gives the listener an image of a mournful, but not heavy, march. Unlike most of music of Holliday, this simple piece contains a tonal center, melody, and meter. The harmonic structure, however, is still post-modern. <cite>Tambopata-Candamo Rain Forest</cite> depicts a
conversation between low, fat chords in the bass and, in contrast, many fast-moving notes in the treble. These moods are analogous to the world on the ground of the rainforest, and the world up in the canopy. The fast-paced <cite>Yucay</cite> movement contains thick, flowing arpeggios that utilize the entire piano's range and represents an old river. <cite>Ollantaytambo</cite> is a fast, stressful movement whose tonal center, almost non-existent, changes quickly, providing for a complex harmonic rhythm.</p>
<p>The form of <cite>Sontata for Piano</cite> is traditionally modeled after the classical sonata. However, Holliday writes with his usual unique contemporary music style. The first movement seems to follow a complex meter and sounds almost counterpoint-like. It is a rather <i>horizontal</i> movement. The second movement, a rapid <i lang="it">scherzo</i>, is happy, playful, and light. The performer's fingers seem to float atop the piano keys. The bittersweet third movement, although technically dissonant, is overall calm and serene. It provides a sense of mourning but also understanding. In contrast with the beginning, the middle section is agitated and tragic. The movement ends quietly and peacefully. The fourth movement starts off with jolting, <i>crunchy</i> chords and goes into soft, flowing melodies and, in contrast, loud block chords. The finale of this work builds tension and picks up tempo, then ends with a consonant chord that extends from the low bass to the high treble on the instrument.</p>
<p><cite>Milongalgusto</cite> is a technically difficult piece with jazzy undertones. It has a swing-like rhythmic feel. More of a homophonic piece, the recurring theme involves parallel chords in both hands.</p>
<p><cite>Hawaiiana</cite> is a six-movement piece performed by four hands on one piano. The sounds in this piece draw out concrete images of an exotic region in the listener's mind. The melody in <cite>Maui</cite> is transferred between the Primary and Secondary pianists. The Secondary part consists of slow-moving chords and melody while the Primary part includes delicate ornaments in the upper register. <cite>Oahu</cite> has a strong meter, making the rhythm easy to follow. It has a fast tempo and is fun to listen to. <cite>Lanai</cite> has a mysterious, steady bass under frilly, elaborate tremolos in the high register. However, both parts eventually find themselves overlapping into each other, in terms of register. In the <cite>Kauai</cite> movement, both the Primary and Secondary parts are very similar to each other. The <i lang="it">arpeggios</i> and chords move seamlessly between the parts. It sounds as if only one person is playing. The last two movements, <cite>Hawaii</cite> and <cite>Molokai</cite>, are not separated by a tacet. <cite>Hawaii</cite>'s theme is a melody of parallel octaves, which represents the ethnicity well. The music strays away from the theme every so often (more frequently toward the end of the movement), but each time it returns back to the parallel octaves. Finally, in <cite>Molokai</cite>, the original theme is discarded. This final movement is very fast, tonal, and harmonic, and portrays emotions of cheer and rush. The piece ends on a fantastic major chord, a fitting conclusion for the concert.</p>
