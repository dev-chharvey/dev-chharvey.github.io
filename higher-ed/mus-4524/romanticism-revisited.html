    <h2><cite>Trio Sonata in C Major for Two Flutes and Continuo</cite></h2>
    <p>Georg Philipp Telemann (<time>1681</time>&ndash;<time>1767</time>)</p>
    <p>Performed by Drs. Jacobson, Crone, Husser, and Bryant</p>
  </header>
  <p>The continuo part includes a harpsichord with a double keyboard. The counterpoint is baroque style in the first movement, and the melody transfers back and fourth between the two flutes and bassoon. The second movement is more homophonic than the first, with more accompanying chords rather than melody. In the third movement, the <i lang="it">presto</i> tempo provides a more cheerful mood, but also changes in mode. The composer takes us in a <i lang="it">stretto</i> section of modulation around the circles of fifths. The fourth movement is a drastic change in <i lang="it">largo</i> tempo. The melody is smooth and flowing over the procession-like bass part in the bassoon and continuo. We return to the fugue-like interplay of voices in the fifth movement, and another modulation progression in the sixth movement. However, this is the first time we hear compound meter in the piece, with the meter in fast 6. The performers have a little trouble with timing, as the piece has difficult groups of triplets. The last movement begins with chant-like voices, but then proceeds right into a lively dance. The section is repeated with variation in ABABCA form. It sounds like the composer took two pieces and glued them together in an alternating manner.</p>

    <h2><cite><i lang="">Vier ernste Gesange</i></cite></h2>
    <p>Johannes Brahms (<time>1833</time>&ndash;<time>1897</time>)</p>
    <p>Performed by Drs. Sipes and Bigler</p>
  </header>
  <p>This piece is a set of four songs, each movement a different song title in German. The first song begins dark and ominous, with a graduate crescendo throughout. The piano part is parallel octaves and fifths in the lowest registers on the instrument, with accompanying right hand countermelody. The baritone voice is long and slow. The B section contrasts greatly from the beginning in that it is frilly, fast, and anxious. The pianist makes use of the wide range of register, jumping octaves and executing trills, runs, and tremolos. The second song shows a great deal of non-traditional harmonic progressions throughout. There is no chromaticism, but many diminished chords and non-chord tones. The third song is similar, with unexpected harmony and modulations. Part <b>A</b> is in minor, insistent, forceful, and almost nasty. Part <b>B</b>, on the other hand, is in major, sweet, and delicate, like a lullaby. The last song begins with an A section that can be described as joyful, light, fast, bright, and majestic. Part B has the same amount of energy but is slower, sweeter, and more expressive and emotional. The pianist voices different species of style.</p>

    <h2><cite><i lang="fr">Reverie et Petite Valse</i></cite></h2>
    <p>Andr&eacute; Caplet (<time>1878</time>&ndash;<time>1925</time>)</p>
    <p>Performed by Drs. Crone and Bigler</p>
  </header>
  <p>This piece is split into two themes: the <i lang="fr">reverie</i> and the <i lang="gr">waltz</i>. The reverie section sounds impressionist. We have parallel chords and <i lang="it">arpeggios</i>, augmented triads, and non-traditional scales (septatonic). There is a clear melody and countermelody, but neither is lyrical. Rather, they are motivic in nature. Contrary to Debussy's music, there is subjective emotion and feeling present. The music pays attention to small aspects rather than focus on the overall picture. This is a Romantic element.</p>
  <p>The waltz section contains <i lang="it">rubato</i>, shows expression, and has a variety of articulation, phrasing, and styles. The overall mood is playful, humorous, and light, reminding the listeners of a nineteenth-century ballroom.</p>
