    <h2><cite>Trio in A-flat Major, Hob. XV:14</cite></h2>
    <p>F. Joseph Haydn (<time>1742</time>&ndash;<time>1809</time>)</p>
  </header>
  <p>The first movement strictly follows the form and harmonic structure of idiomatic 18<span class="superscript">th</span> Century <i lang="it">sonata-allegro</i> pieces. Haydn adds his well-known character and style to this trio. The expressive violin and cello parts are smooth and flowing in contrast to the technically fast trills and runs in the piano part. The violinist works especially hard to bring out the differences in articulation. In the second movement, the section with piano solo and pizzicato string accompaniment shows off the pianist's abilities with decorative ornaments, trills, and turns. The <i class="it">rondo</i> movement is lively and energetic. The listener can feel a sense of building energy throughout this movement. The main motif is in an odd meter. Haydn deceives us with false endings frequently, but finishes the trio with an exciting phrase.</p>

    <h2><cite>Suite from Silent Faustus</cite></h2>
    <p>John D'Earth (<time>1950</time>&ndash;present)</p>
  </header>
  <p>This piece, with a little bit of dissonance and transgressing harmony, is very <i>cartoon-like</i> and contains a lot of imagery. Not without harmony, it is difficult to hear where the tonal centers are. The piece demands both technical and musical skills of the performers. The improvisational violin solo and <i>beat box</i> accompaniment have strong ethnic undertones. The climax of the first section is on the threshold of violent. The improvisational Cello solo and piano accompaniment is a mournful and emotional section. The listener may be reminded of a rainy day in the city. The last section of the piece returns to the original theme and finishes by incorporating those that occur throughout the piece.</p>
