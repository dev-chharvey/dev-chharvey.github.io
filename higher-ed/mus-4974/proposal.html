<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<p>The student will produce an interactive multimedia work to explain and demonstrate the theory and practical application of Ambisonics research and multichannel audio production. The work itself will include text, sound, graphics, video, and user interactivity. The content of the work will include background information on the origin and general nature of Ambisonics, and its formats and order encodings. In addition to the theory, the work will cover the practical applications and unique advantages of Ambisonic recordings as well as a step-by-step analysis of the application of this technology. An example will also be given: the student will conduct a live recording session of a short piece (about 6 minutes) performed by a solo pianist using the <i>Soundfield MkV</i> microphone in the recording studio. An explanation of the step-by-step processes involved (from the performance to the final mix) and demonstration of the key advantages will accompany the analysis in the work. Evaluation will be based on regular meetings and presentations of progress as well as the accuracy and artistic merit of the final work.</p>
