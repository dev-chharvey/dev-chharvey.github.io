    <h2>from the <cite>Well-Tempered Claver, Book I</cite></h2>
    <p class="composer">J.S. Bach</p>
  </header>
  <p>The first thing I noticed about the Prelude and Fugue in C Major was that Salmon uses pedal, and it is common knowledge that the pedal wasn't introduced on the piano until the late Classical period. Salmon also distorts tempo by using <i lang="it">rubato</i> and <i lang="it">ritardando</i> to bring out the primary voice. The piece is mellow, calming, and reminds the listener of flowing water. There is not much range in dynamics, which helps contribute to the imagery. The Fugue's subjects were distinct and clear, and the stretto and episode sections are played passionately.</p>
  <p>The <cite>Prelude and Fugue in F Major</cite> is a cheerful, fast, and virtuosic piece in a <span class="time-signature">3/4</span> dance-like meter. The Prelude is a 3:1 species counterpoint and the Fugue is stated and confident. Salmon shows a wide range in articulation and makes obvious the difference between <i lang="it">staccato</i> and <i lang="it">legato</i> passages. He transitions directly into the <cite>Prelude and Fugue in F-Sharp Minor</cite> without pause, improvising the transition. (This element is one of the topics of his workshop, <b>Ornamenting Bach.</b>)</p>
  <p>The <cite>Prelude and Fugue in F-Sharp Minor</cite> is a thoughtful piece deep in meaning. The performer expresses big dynamic contrast between the parts and uses <i lang="it">rubato</i>. The last few bars of the Fugue are clearly improvised: Salmon doubles the octave in the left hand and extends the piano register beyond that which existed in Bach's time.</p>
  <p>With another improvisatory transition into the <cite>Prelude and Fugue in A Major</cite>, the piece starts out somewhat tentative and hesitant but develops the material quickly. Salmon seems lost in the music, oblivious to the environment around him. He shows excitement, emotion, and facial expressions while playing. He has fun with the piece, despite his position on stage in front of a live audience.</p>

    <h2><cite>Sonata No. 3 in C Major, Op. 2 No. 3</cite></h2>
    <p class="composer">L.V. Beethoven</p>
  </header>
  <p>The first movement starts out in a gleeful exposition with virtuosic passages and melodies. The silence in the first phrases and between the first and second theme groups is striking. The closing theme is soft and melodious, played passionately and carefully by the pianist. Beethoven takes us around the circle of fifths in the development section, leading to a strong tonic in the recapitulation. He uses octave jumps, double octaves, and octave <i lang="it">tremolos</i> in the restatement of the theme groups. Beethoven introduces deceptive cadences, and rising diminished sevenths chords by semitone, which present a degree of chromaticism. The <i lang="it">codetta</i> and <i lang="it">coda</i> are strong and lively, evolving the repeated material. Salmon's hands are so agile and light that they float across the keys with ease.</p>
  <p>Low octaves in the second movement accompany light eighth notes in the right hand, a contrast to the quarter-half-quarter note rhythm in the upper register. The third and penultimate movement of the sonata is a short scherzo form with a playfully fast and satirical tempo. The trio section is extremely dark, with long, thick, fluid chords in the left hand that accompany fast light arpeggios in the right.</p>
  <p>It is interesting to note that this sonata, one of Beethoven's earliest opuses, contains four movements&mdash;most at the time had three. The final movement is in compound duple meter. The lyrical and singing melody in addition to the church-like choral in the second theme pose for an exciting end to the sonata. Salmon's mood is not only apparent in his music but also in his facial expressions. He engages the audience in the performance.</p>

    <h2><cite>Glances</cite></h2>
    <p class="composer">Dave Brubeck</p>
  </header>
  <p>Brubeck is greatly known for his stylistic aspects of parallel harmonies, modality, odd rhythms and changing meters, and non-traditional chords. The <cite>Overture</cite> is a bright piece that encompasses many of these aspects. It is not in major mode, although it does sound diatonic and consonant. There are many <i lang="it">hemiolas</i>, triplets, and other odd groupings in the melodies that contrast a steady <i>boom-chick</i> beat in the bass. The piece loses a sense of pulse due to the complex rhythms.</p>
  <p><cite>Struttin&rsquo;</cite> employs jazzy rhythms and melodies with modern scale degrees such as <span>m7</span>, <span>m3</span>, <span>+4</span>, and parallel fourths and frequent modulation. The swing beat, <i lang="it">tremolo</i> chords (jazz hands), and syncopation make the piece easy to tap your foot to.</p>
  <p>The placement of <cite>Blue Aria</cite> is analogous to a classical third movement marked <i lang="it">Adagio</i>. The main theme is a melancholy voice with a soft chord accompaniment. Long arpeggios in the left hand with chords in the right hand build up to a strong forte in the <b>B</b> section, and then the <b>A</b> section's quiet melody returns with a jazzy variation.</p>
  <p>Jazzy scale degrees make their way into the last movement entitled <cite>Doin&rsquo; the Charleston</cite>. The piece is polyphonic with equal voices in both hands. The piano seems to
  sing.</p>

    <h2><cite>Improvisations on Themes by Dave Brubeck</cite></h2>
    <p class="composer">John Salmon</p>
  </header>
  <p>These last few pieces of the night are improvisations by John Salmon on a select few of Brubeck's tunes. Salmon utilizes moving chords, walking baselines, and often changes in style, texture, and meter. The melodies are not always apparent, especially when he brings them in stealthily. However, the pieces really become alive when he speeds the tempo and cranks the volume. Salmon's music is so visual that it sounds easy to orchestrate for jazz band. The listener can hear the various instruments and their separate parts in the performance. His music also produces imagery. The third tune, <cite>Three to Get Ready</cite>, is extremely reminiscent of a calm walk in the park on a sunny weekend. The finale of the concert is a busy conglomerate of single notes, dissonant chords, scales, <i lang="it">arpeggios</i>, and fast repeated notes. This piece I suspect, unlike the others that have been strictly improvisational, has been previously composed and prepared by Salmon himself.</p>
