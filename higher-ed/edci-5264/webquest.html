  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this activity is to increase your understanding of statistical modeling and data plotting. You will be researching the composition dates of the complete works of the 19<span class="superscript">th</span> Century romantic composer, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin. In addition to researching, organizing, and plotting data, you will have the opportunity to reflect on some theoretical questions involving statistics as well.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The Task</h2>
  <p>Get together in groups of two. You will need to find a list of Chopin's works. Note that the Opus numbers do <em>not</em> directly correspond to composition dates. Your task is to organize his works in chronological order and make statistical inferences based on patterns you see.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Activities:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Find a list of Chopin's complete works and composition dates. Just the year is sufficient. Be sure to order them chronologically.</li>
      <li>Make a <b>stem-and-leaf plot</b> of his works, based on year.</li>
      <li>Find the five-number-summary: the <b>lower extreme</b>, <b>lower quartile</b>, <b>median</b>, <b>upper quartile</b>, and <b>upper extreme</b> of the data set.</li>
      <li>Using the <b>five-number-summary</b>, draw a <b>box-and-whisker plot</b> of the data.</li>
      <li>Find the <b>mean</b>, <b>variance</b>, and <b>standard deviation</b> of the data set.</li>
      <li>Find the <b>range</b> and <b>mode</b> of the data set.</li>
      <li>Draw a <b>histogram</b> using your data from the stem-and-leaf plot. Decide on what type of <b>skew</b> the data has.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Questions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In the area of Statistics, why might we find it useful to organize Chopin's works chronologically?</li>
      <li>Is this data set a <b>discrete</b> or <b>continuous</b> data set? Explain the difference between the two types.</li>
      <li>Discuss the advantages of using the <b>median</b> value over the <b>mean</b> value.</li>
      <li>Using the histogram, how can the <b>median</b> and <b>mode</b> be interpreted graphically?</li>
      <li>Knowing how to calculate variance and standard deviation is great, but how are they useful? Discuss the importance and meaning of the <b>variance</b> and <b>standard deviation</b> of a data set.</li>
      <li>What do the <b>stem-and-leaf plot</b> and the <b>histogram</b> have in common? What do they show that the <b>box-and-whisker plot</b> cannot?</li>
      <li>Explain how one <b>outlier</b> can dramatically affect the <b>range</b> of a data set. How is the range useful in real life?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>The Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In groups of two, one partner should take on the statistical activities while the other partner researches the questions. Each partner should be interacting and discussing their processes with the other partner.</li>
    <li>Near the end of the class period, both partners should be familiar with how to complete the activities <strong>as well as</strong> the findings to the questions.</li>
    <li>Each group will turn in their notes discussing what processes they used to complete the activities. Show your work.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Learning Advice</h2>
  <p>Each group is to jot down notes and findings as they are working. These notes will be turned in, so make sure they are copious. However, quality is more important than quantity. It is more important to obtain the big ideas and concepts involved, and not to focus on the small details. With the number of resources at your disposal, you do not have enough time to read them thoroughly. Observe the titles, subtitles, pictures and captions, and diagrams. It is sufficient to skim long texts for main ideas. Feel free to venture outside the given sources. Do cite any new sources you come across, if you are using important information from them.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This WebQuest should have helped you gain better insight on the usefulness and practicality of statistics and data organizing, as well as practice with data plotting and making statistical inferences. In addition to the statistical aspect, this activity should have enhanced your research skills and your ability to extract, organize, and summarize information from a multitude of resources.</p>
