  <h2 id="CBRlesson">Bouncing Ball Lesson</h2>
  <p>Download Texas Instruments' lesson entitled &quot;<a href="../lessons/4BouncingBall.pdf">Bouncing Ball</a>&quot;, with accompanying teacher information.</p>
  <p>This lesson uses the Calculator-Based Ranger 2 and would be most suitable in an Algebra I class, or possibly as a review in an Algebra II class. In this lesson, the students will use the CBR-2 to collect the position data from a free-falling object, and then try to constrcut a quadratic function to fit the data collected. Below are two screenshots of my group's data.</p>
  <div class="!ta:c">

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img class="!w:3oa" src="../images/CBR2_demo/ball2.jpg" alt="a parabolic approximation of one curve"/>
  </div>
  <p>The CBR-2 is an excellent tool for collecting data on position, velocity, and acceleration. In the lesson above, students will recognize that since the acceleration due to gravity of all objects is (virtually) constant, the position of those objects will follow a quadratic rule. In another activity, our group tried to match the given graphs of distance and velocity functions by walking toward or away from a wall. The CBR-2 puts constant, linear,  quadratic, and other families of functions in a visual and concrete representation, so students will create a better understanding of these concepts. Not to mention, students will remember these concepts more easily because of the hands-on experiences.</p>
  <p>For more advanced students, connections to Calculus can be made, such as the relationships between tangent lines to curves and areas under curves. Another optional exploration from this lesson arises from the vertices of the parabolas of a bouncing object. Notice the screenshot on the left. The vertices create an exponential function of the form <span class="math">y=hx<sup>p</sup></span>.</p>

    <h3>VA SOL Standards and NCTM Standards </h3>
    <p>The lesson Bouncing Ball addresses the following SOL standards:</p>
    <section>
      <h4>Algebra I Standards </h4>
      <p class="hindent-5">A.5 The student will create and use tabular, symbolic, graphical, verbal, and physical representations to analyze a given set of data for the existence of a pattern, determine the domain and range of relations, and identify the relations that are functions.</p>
      <p class="hindent-5">A.15  The student will, given a rule, find the values of a function for elements in its domain and locate the zeros of the function both algebraically and with a graphing calculator. The value of f(x) will be related to the ordinate on the graph.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Algebra II Standards</h4>
      <p class="hindent-5">AII.8 The student will recognize multiple representations of functions (linear, quadratic, absolute value, step, and exponential functions) and convert between a graph, a table, and symbolic form. A transformational approach to graphing will be employed through the use of graphing calculators.</p>
      <p class="hindent-5">AII.15 The student will recognize the general shape of polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. The graphing calculator will be used as a tool to investigate the shape and behavior of these functions.</p>
      <p class="hindent-5">AII.18 The student will identify conic sections (circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola) from his/her equations. Given the equations in (h, k) form, the student will sketch graphs of conic sections, using transformations.</p>
      <p class="hindent-5">AII.19 The student will collect and analyze data to make predictions and solve practical problems. Graphing calculators will be used to investigate scatterplots and to determine the equation for a curve of best fit. Models will include linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions.</p>

    <h3>Possible Modifications to this Lesson</h3>
    <p>I liked how the lesson explores the value of A (the coefficient of the squared term). Further, I would include the values of H and K so that students will see the connections made between these values and the vertex of any parabolic segment of the data collection. </p>
