  <h2>Philosophy on Best Practice for Use of Technology</h2>
  <p>Technology is a term we throw around, but what does it really mean? Throughout the ages, mankind has been constantly progressing in gaining knowledge and tools. Depending on the culture and time frame, technology is relative. According to an ancient Grecian, an automobile would be considered a great deal of technology, while we take cars for granted all the time. Whether we're talking about metal quills or smart pens, technology is relative to the culture that defines it.</p>
  <p>In the mathematics classroom, technology has also been progressing. When the four-function calculator was invented, there was much debate about whether students should be able to use it in the classroom, on homework, and on exams. Today, the same debate arises about Computer Algebra Systems. I believe, however, that the debate shouldn't be about which technologies we use, but it is a matter of how fast we use them. The aid of technology also helps level the playing field. Students from low-income families will have the same access as those who come from middle-upper class families. </p>
  <p>Technology should also be a tool and aid for students, but should not be their brain for them. Students with technology should focus on the bigger problems at hand, such as those involving decision-making and problem-solving. It's not as important anymore to know how to find the prime factors or the cube root of a positive integer because the calculator can do it for us. Granted, some educators argue that there are some things students <em>should</em> learn how to do first, but it's the teacher's job to decide how important it is. Once the students learn how to do something, they can use the CAS to do it for them afterward. The math course should be more focused on general abilities and using operations to understand meaning, rather than computational skills, algorithms, or procedures. Technology should extend math and enhance learning and develop theory of mathematical concepts which are necessary to interpret real-world models and applications.</p>
  <p>I want to be able to use technology to guide students' learning, not to replace my teaching. My purpose as teacher is to help students investigate and understand relationships among objects, and to <strong>complexify</strong> this investigation so that the students can <strong>simplify</strong> it. Rather than making decisions about what and how to investigate, my job is to guide students to make those decisions, and reaffirm that they're making the right (or wrong) ones. Students would get a more beneficial (and intriguing) experience if they could investigate and discover things for themselves.</p>

  <h2>Advice for Teachers</h2>
  <p>During my first year of teaching, I will commit to implement <a href="technology/GSP.html">Geometer's Sketchpad</a>. I believe this is an excellent technology to use in the classroom because of its many applications across all content areas in the mathematics curriculum. Aside from its abundance of utilizations in geometry classes, GSP also has many uses in functional analysis and similar topics in algebra and calculus. The robustness of GSP is ideal for demonstrating to students a derivation of any particular formula or concept.</p>
  <p>I love planning lessons using Geometer's Sketchpad. I think it's a great way to show students <em>how</em> things work, like an informal proof, except rather than proving something already known, we are constructing something completely new (new for the class, but not for mathematicians). Watch <a href="technology/GSP.html">my podcast</a> on the derivation of the three basic trigonometric functions.</p>
  <p>When planning lessons, my advice would be to start basic. Review the prerequisite concepts necessary for the lesson as a warm up, and when introducing new concepts, try to get the students to create their own definitions, with guidance of course. Use GSP to create these new concepts or figures and let the students play with it. If it is wrong, students will realize that either they have misused the technology or they need to reconsider their definitions. Make it clear to them that the technology is never wrong. (For example, when a student thinks he has entered <kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">5</kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">&times;</kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">6</kbd>
  </kbd>in the calculator and obtains 11, he may think that the calculator has malfunctioned, when in fact he has unknowingly entered <kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">5</kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">+</kbd>
    <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">6</kbd>
  </kbd>. The calculator is never wrong; only the input can be wrong.)</p>
  <p>After the students are satisfied with their definitions and constructions, it is time to explore properties of these figures. Try to get the students to think about the behavior of these objects, whether they be geometrical figures or algebraic functions. Ask them how the figure would change if one of its parents was changed, or missing. Then ask them to see if their conjecture was right by carrying out the hypothesis. Just as important as what would be different is what would be the same. Ask the students to notice what <em>doesn't</em> change when parents change. This will help them see the connections between and interdependencies of objects.</p>
  <p>After the exploration classtime, I would suggest posing a challenge problem at the end of the lesson. This problem may be one that is mandatory to solve, just an extra credit problem that serves as <i>food for thought</i>, or anything in between. Exploration is stimulating and exciting, but students should get in the habit of working toward a goal, that is, the solution to a problem (even though students hate word problems, I would suggest a word problem because students will need to translate between English and Math; the more they do this, the more they will think about their world as a mathematical model). Students need to think creatively and make decisions about <em>why</em> to use the technology they have been using, not just how to use it. For a fun example of extracurricular work, <a href="../../core/JavaSketchpad/Kaleidoscope.html">see my kaleidoscope</a>.</p>
  <p>A few pedagogical issues to consider when implementing Geometer's Sketchpad: Depending on your availability of the program, students should be able to work in groups. Communication is important, especially if we want students to be able to translate between colloquial student language and rigorous mathematical language. Reasoning and Proof is one of the processes that helps communication flourish. Another reason to have students work in groups is that since each student's mind is different, each student will have a different point of view on the activity, which increases the likelihood of multiple representations and a more diverse conversation.</p>
