  <h2>Lesson Description </h2>
  <p>Students will use the <a href="../technology/handhelds/TI-Nspire.html">TI-Nspire CAS</a> to prove their conjecture that a given shape is a parallelogram.</p>
<section class="SOLborder">
  <h2>VA SOL Standards</h2>
  <p>This lesson is suitable for students in an Algebra I classroom.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Algebra I Standards</h3>
    <p class="hindent-5">A.1 The student will solve multistep linear equations and inequalities in one variable, solve literal equations (formulas) for a given variable, and apply these skills to solve practical problems. Graphing calculators will be used to confirm algebraic solutions.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Algebra II Standards</h3>
    <p class="hindent-5">AII.8 The student will recognize multiple representations of functions (linear, quadratic, absolute value, step, and exponential functions) and convert between a graph, a table, and symbolic form. A transformational approach to graphing will be employed through the use of graphing calculators.</p>

  <h2>Lesson Outline (Modifications)</h2>
  <p>This lesson is a modification of the <em><a href="ExploringMath_Inequality_Act4.pdf">Perimeters, Areas and Slopes&mdash;Oh, My!</a></em> lesson provided by Texas Instruments, for the <a href="../technology/handhelds/graphcalcs.html">TI-84</a> handheld. The original lesson makes use of the <em>Inequalz</em> application on the TI-84.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><img src="../images/Inequalz_demo/functions.jpg" alt="functions"/>On the CAS, open a new document and save it as <span class="math">Inequalz</span>. Add a <span class="math">Graphs</span> page. Enter and graph the following functions. You will see the <span class="math">f1(x)</span>  change to <span class="math">y</span> when you change the equals sign (<span class="math">=</span>)  to a less than (<span class="math">&le;</span>) or greater than (<span class="math">&ge;</span>) sign.</li>
    <li><img src="../images/Inequalz_demo/window.jpg" alt="window"/>After you have graphed the functions, change your window settings to those shown to the right. </li>
    <li><img src="../images/Inequalz_demo/graphs.jpg" alt="graphs"/>You should see a screen like this. (See the 'Other Advice' below on the shading of the feasible region.) </li>
    <li><img src="../images/Inequalz_demo/intersect.jpg" alt="graphs"/>Click <span class="math">Intersection Point(s)</span> under the <span class="math">Points &amp; Lines</span> menu. Then click any two lines that intersect in your graph. The intersection point will be created and its coordinates will be displayed. Use this tool to find the other three intersection points. Press the <span class="math">esc</span> button to exit out of the tool. Now label the points by 'Right clicking' (pressing <span class="math">ctrl</span> then <span class="math">menu</span>) on each point. From the origin, go counterclockwise, <span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">B</span>, <span class="math">C</span>, <span class="math">D</span>.</li>
    <li>As in steps 5 and 6 in the lesson, brainstorm ideas on how to determine whether quadrilateral <span class="math">ABCD</span> is a parallelogram. Provide mathematical evidence to support your conclusion. As in step 7, calculate the perimeter and area of <span class="math">ABCD</span>. </li>

  <h2>Notes on this Lesson</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Appropriate Use of Technology</h3>
    <p>As the <a href="ExploringMath_Inequality_Act4.pdf">original lesson</a> calls for, the <a href="../technology/handhelds/graphcalcs.html">TI-84</a> is a sutible tool for completing this activity.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Other Advice</h3>
    <p>When graphing inequalities on the <a href="../technology/handhelds/TI-Nspire.html">Nspire</a>, the calculator will shade the <em>union</em> of the functions, rather than the <em>intersection</em>. For example, when graphing <span class="math">y&ge;0</span> and <span class="math">y&le;5</span>, the entire screen will be shaded instead of only the feasible region. This is something to watch out for when implementing this lesson.</p>
