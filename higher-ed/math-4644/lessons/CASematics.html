  <h2>Instructional Plan</h2>
  <p>This lesson is meant to last over a course of multiple class periods. The questions posed in this lesson outline are  for discussion and serve as a guide for the teacher. Students' answers do not need to be turned in. However, students are expected to discuss with their classmates and take down their observations, conjectures, reasoning, results, and any anamolies along the way. At the end of the lesson, students will summarize their notes, to be handed in for a grade.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Imagine you're in a world where gravity pulls <b>downward</b> at an acceleration of 2 feet per second per second. You are standing on top of a platform that is 6 feet off the ground, and you throw a ball <b>down</b> at an initial velocity of <span class="M">v_0</span> feet per second. At what time <span class="M">t_f</span> will the ball hit the ground? Express the time the ball hits the ground as a function of initial velocity, using <span class="M">t_f(v_0)</span> as the function. Graph this function.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Get into groups of three. Open and save a new document in your CAS and create a new problem. Add:
          <ol>
            <li>a new spreadsheet page,</li>
            <li>a graph page,</li>
            <li>another spreadsheet page, and</li>
            <li>one data and statistics page.</li>
          </ol>
          For the most part, we will be using the first two pages. We will use the last two pages near the end of this lesson.</li>
    <li>In page 1, construct a spreadsheet with four columns: Time (<b>T</b>), Acceleration (<b>A</b>), Velocity (<b>V</b>), and Height (<b>H</b>). Which column do you think represents the independent variable? Which columns represent the dependent variables?</li>
    <li>Start putting entry values in the <b>T</b> column, starting with 0 and going down to 10, with intervals of 0.5. At the very bottom, put <b>t</b>, which is a variable that will represent any time T=<var>t</var>.</li>
    <li>Go to page 3, and label the first column <b>VO</b> and the second column <b>TF</b>. We will save this page for later, so for now, go back to page 1.</li>
    <li>Read the lesson problem. Discuss with your group how you would begin to approach solving the problem.</li>
    <li>If the gravitational value is constant, what will your <b>A</b> column look like? For all 21 rows, input the acceleration of the ball. In the bottom row, find a function <span class="M">a(t)</span> which will return the value of the ball's acceleration at any given time <var>t</var>. After you have found your formula, replace your cell entries with this formula for each cell in the <b>A</b> column. Did the values change? If so, why did they change? If not, why not?</li>
    <li>Repeat step 6 for the <b>V</b> and <b>H</b> columns. For now, use the initial velocity <span class="M">v_0=1</span>.</li>
    <li>Now that you have obtained an equation <span class="M">h(t)</span> representing the height of the ball dependent on time, input this function in <b>f1</b> on page 2 and graph it. What does it look like? Describe some properties of this graph. Use your knowledge of the types of graphs that we have been covering in class.</li>
    <li>Algebraically, what does it mean when the ball hits the ground? Call this point in time <span class="M">t_f</span>. Where do you think <span class="M">t_f</span> is represented on the graph? Find the time <span class="M">t_f</span> at which the ball will hit the ground, explaining the steps you used to do so.</li>
    <li>Go to page 3 in your CAS. In row 1 under <b>VO</b>, put the value of <span class="M">v_0</span>. Under <b>Tf</b>, put the value you found for <span class="M">t_f</span>.</li>
    <li>Go back to page 1. <em>Change</em> your initial velocity to <span class="M">v_0=2</span>. Now that <span class="M">v_0</span> has changed, what happened to your <b>A</b>, <b>V</b>, and <b>H</b> columns? Which columns (if any) need to change? If any changes need to be made, please make them now.</li>
    <li>Go back to page 2. Keeping your old graph <b>f1</b>, create a <em>new</em> graph <b>f2</b> on top of the old one that represents the new equation for height, after <span class="M">v_0</span> has changed. How do the graphs differ? How are they the same? Find the <em>new</em> time <span class="M">t_f</span> when the ball hits the ground. How do the two times compare? Think about this intuitively: if <span class="M">v_0</span> is faster, will <span class="M">t_f</span> be earlier or later? Does your intuition agree with your observations?</li>
    <li>Go back to page 3 and on the second row, enter the second set of values for <span class="M">v_0</span> and <span class="M">t_f</span>. Are you beginning to see some sort of relationship? We will come back to this later.</li>
    <li>Begin to experiment with different values of <span class="M">v_0</span>, using values between 0 and 5, on intervals of 0.5.  What happens to the columns in page 1? Do they change, and if so, how? What happens to your graphs in page 2? What happens to <span class="M">t_f</span>? Keep switching back and fourth between page 1 and page 2, noticing how different values of <span class="M">v_0</span> affect the graph and how they affect <span class="M">t_f</span>. What kind of trend is <span class="M">t_f</span> showing? How does this compare to your conjecture in step 13?</li>
    <li>Every time you obtain a new pair of <span class="M">v_0</span> and <span class="M">t_f</span>, enter a new row in page 3. Is your conjecture from step 13 consistent? Again, we will come back to this.</li>
    <li>Now we are going to generalize initial velocity. Let <span class="M">v_0-v_0</span>.  Remember, you will not be able to use numbers, so you might need to express things in terms of letters. Try to express velocity and height as general functions of time with a general initial velocity. After you have your generalized height function, go back to page 2 and erase all of your graphs. Create a parameter <span class="M">v_0</span> in your CAS and use this variable parameter to  define your generalized height function. Graph this function in <b>f1</b>. Change <span class="M">v_0</span>, using the same values as in step 14. What happens to the graph? Is this in any way different from what you did in step 14? Notice what happens to <span class="M">t_f</span>, visually, as <span class="M">v_0</span> changes. Does your observation of the trend of <span class="M">t_f</span> agree with your observation in step 14? Does it agree with your intuition? What do you think is causing <span class="M">t_f</span> to behave this way?</li>
    <li>Capture the values of <span class="M">v_0</span> and <span class="M">t_f</span> as you change <span class="M">v_0</span>, and enter these captured values on page 3. Graph a <b>scatter plot</b> of these points on page 4. What kind of graph does it look like? Make a conjecture of what equation this graph might have. Is it consistent with your conjectures from steps 13 and 15? Does your conjectured equation agree with your observations of the trends from steps 14 and 16?</li>
    <li>Explicitly define <span class="M">t_f</span> as a function of <span class="M">v_0</span>. Which one is the independent variable and which one is dependent? Is this usually the case? What's the difference here? Explain what kind of relationship  the two variables have. What happens to one when the other changes in a certain way? On page 4, graph this function in <b>f2</b> over the scatter plot.  How does it compare with the points in the scatter plot? Describe some of the properties of this graph. Is it positive/negative? increasing/decreasing? opening up/opening down? What happens to the graph as <span class="M">v_0</span> becomes very large? Describe how this <b>end behavior</b> relates to your intuitive understanding of time of collision.</li>
    <li><i>[Extra credit: What conic section might this graph look like? How might the equation of the graph relate to the equation of the section? Does the section have asymptotes? If so, how might you find them?]</i></li>
    <li>Write a summary of this lesson's activities, including your observations, conjectures, reasoning, results, and anomalies. If you have any questions, record those too.</li>

    <h3>Appropriate Use of Technology</h3>
    <p>The utilization of the Computer Algebra System is a great use of technology in this lesson. The lesson was constructed for the purpose of using CAS, so some of the activities, <i lang="la"><abbr title="exampli gratia">e.g.</abbr></i>, changing predictors, complements the CAS well. In a static-state technology tool, one would have to re-construct dependents of parameters whereas the CAS is dynamic and changes them as the parameters change.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>The steps and questions in the lesson outline are for the teacher's use only. Teachers should use the questions as a guide for the lesson to elicit student activity and participation, but students' answers need not be turned in (students will, however, need to take notes and turn in their observations, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>). This lesson does not yet have an accompanying worksheet or procedure to follow.</p>
