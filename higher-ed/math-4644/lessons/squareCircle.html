  <h2>Lesson Description</h2>
  <p>Students will explore relationships between the areas of circles and squares, as functions of radius and side, respectively. In addition, students will attempt to use Plato's rules of geometric construction to construct a square with exact area equal to a given circle. The main goal of this lesson are that students will become familiar with Plato's rules of construction and explore one of the most impossible problems of antiquity.</p>

  <h2>VA SOL Standards</h2>
  <p>This lesson is suitable for a high school introductory Geometry course. </p>

    <h3>Geometry Standards</h3>
    <p class="hindent-5">G.10 The student will investigate and solve practical problems involving circles, using properties of angles, arcs, chords, tangents, and secants. Problems will include finding arc length and the area of a sector, and may be drawn from applications of architecture, art, and construction.</p>
    <p class="hindent-5">G.14 The student will a)  use proportional reasoning to solve practical problems, given similar geometric objects; and b)  determine how changes in one dimension of an object affect area and/or volume of the object.</p>

  <h2>Lesson Outline</h2>
  <p>What does it mean to square a circle? Well, think about this: if you are given a circle with a specific area, try to construct a square with the same exact area using only these rules of construction (specified by Plato):</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Given any two points, there exists exactly one unique straight line between them.</li>
    <li>Given any two points, there exists exactly one unique circle centered at one point and passing through the other.</li>
    <li>Between two straight lines, there exist exactly one of the following:
      <ol>
        <li>exactly zero points of intersection.</li>
        <li>exactly one point of intersection.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Any geometric construction must take a finite number of proceses.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Notes on this Lesson</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>Possible Modifications</h3>
    <p>In addition to the web applet, I would include more in-depth activities for the lesson. The applet is superficial and students may become bored easily after a short amount of time. I would like to either include more lesson problems with <b>Squaring The Circle</b>, or introduce all three major problems of antiquity in one class period. The other two problems of antiquity are <b>Trisecting The Angle</b> and <b>Doubling The Cube</b>.</p>

    <h3>Appropriate Use of Technology</h3>
    <p>This lesson  utilizes an online Internet applet and it introduces students to state-of-the-art technology. Students will be aware that there is a multitude of tools used for instruction these days, not limited to textbooks and worksheets.</p>

    <h3>Other Advice</h3>
    <p>Although this lesson is a fun and interesting activity, it is short and superficial. Try to incorporate more activities in the classroom alongside this lesson. </p>
