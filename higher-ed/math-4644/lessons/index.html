  <h1>Lesson Plans</h1>
  <p>This page includes lesson plans I have either constructed or &quot;borrowed&quot; and revised/modified. Each lesson covers a particular topic or concept, utilizes certain applications, and meets some of the VA SOL standards. To see the lesson itself, click the <b>Lesson Name</b> in the table below. To read about the technologies featured, the link in the <b>Problem Description</b> column will lead you to its &ldquo;Tech In Action&rdquo; page. There are miscellaneous (uncategorized) lessons at the bottom of this page.</p>

  <h2>Miscellaneous Lessons</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>MATH 4626 Research Project</h3>
    <p><a href="/MATH-4626/">My own constructed tutorial</a> on limits, how to find them, and how to identify different types of undefined limits. This lesson's applications focus on the pure theory of limits. Standards met: APC.2, APC.4.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>WebQuest</h3>
    <p>The assignment is to complete an online activity in the subject of <a href="../../EDCI-5264/webquest.php">Statistics</a>. Students will have to do extensive (<em>not intensive</em>) research and answer a series of questions.</p>

    <h3>What is a paradox?</h3>
    <p>No, it is not a team of two doctors. A paradox is a logical impossibility that is derived from seemingly acceptable propositions. The following descriptions are examples of something called a <dfn id="d-catch-22">Catch-22</dfn>, a specific type of paradox in which one object is needed to obtain another object, which in turn, is needed to obtain the original object.</p>
    <blockquote class="example">You lock your keys in your car. In order to get your car key, you must unlock your car, for which you need the key. What do you do?</blockquote>
    <blockquote class="example">In order to find a job, you must have experience in the work field. In order to get experiene in the field, you have to have a job. Where do you start?</blockquote>
    <blockquote class="example">Which came first: the chicken or the egg? Chickens can only be hatched from eggs, which can only be laid by chickens.</blockquote>
    <p>Another type of paradox, called a <dfn id="d-self-reference">self-reference</dfn>, is illustrated by the following sentence. Can you explain what is going on?</p>
    <blockquote class="example">This statement is false.</blockquote>
    <p>To find out about some more famous historical <span class="math">mathematical</span> paradoxes, see <a href="http://www.mathcs.org/analysis/reals/history/zeno.html">Zeno's Paradoxes</a>.</p>
