        The need to understand and be able to use mathematics in everyday life
        and in the workplace has never been grater and will continue to increase.
      section
        h2 Mathematics for Life
        p.
          Knowing mathematics can be personally satisfying and empowering. The
          underpinnings of everyday life are increasingly mathematical and technological.
          For instance, making purchasing decisions, choosing insurance or health plans,
          and voting knowledgeably all call for quantitative sophistication.
      section
        h2 Mathematics as a Part of Cultural Heritage
        p.
          Mathematics is one of the greatest cultural and intellectual achievements
          of humankind, and citizens should develop an appreciation and understanding of that
          achievement, including its aesthetic and even recreational aspects.
      section
        h2 Mathematics in the Workplace
        p.
          Just as the level of mathematics needed for intelligent citizenship has
          increased dramatically, so too has the level of mathematical thinking and problem
          solving needed in the workplace, in professional areas ranging from health care
          to graphic design.
      section
        h2 Mathematics for the Scientific and Technical Community
        p.
          Although all careers require a foundation of mathematical knowledge, some
          are mathematics intensive. More students must pursue an educational path that will
          prepare them for lifelong work as mathematicians, statisticians, engineers, and
          scientists.
