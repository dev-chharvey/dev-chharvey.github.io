and a&nbsp;Rainbow&nbsp;Bridge of many colors.</p><p>When our beloved pets pass, they go to Rainbow&nbsp;Bridge to
run and play together.
There&nbsp;is always food, water, and warm spring sunshine.</p><p>All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor.
Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we
remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy
and content, except for one small thing: they each miss someone very special
to them, who had to be left behind.</p><p>The day comes when one stops
and looks into the distance. Her bright eyes are intent; her eager body
quivers. Suddenly she begins to run from the group, flying over the
field, her legs carrying her faster and faster.</p><p>You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet,
you cling together in joyous reunion. The happy
kisses rain upon your face, your hands again caress her beloved head, and
you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from
your life but never absent from your heart.</p><p>Then you cross Rainbow&nbsp;Bridge together, never to be parted again.</p><footer><cite>&mdash; author unknown</cite></footer></blockquote></main></body></html>
