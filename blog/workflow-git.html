          This is my attempt to briefly describe my workflow on a project using
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/" rel="external">Git</a>.
          First I think a little background information is necessary, and that is information
          on semantic versioning, the principle of numbering your versions semantically.

        <h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>
        <p>
          This section describes my modifications to
          <a href="http://semver.org/" rel="external">Tom Preston-Werner&rsquo;s 
            <cite>Sematnic Versioning</cite></a>.
          You can read more about it there, but in this section I will attempt to apply the analogy
          of semantic versioning in software development to that in web development&mdash;which
          we can all agree, is a field in and of itself.
        </p>
        <p>Semantic Versioning is a model in which every version number of an 
          <dfn id="app">app</dfn>
          (repostory, program, module, website, app, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>)
          has a meaningful indication to users and developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, the version number of an app is written as
          <code>v
            <var>X</var>.
            <var>Y</var>.
            <var>Z</var></code>, where
          
          <var>X</var> is the major version,
          
          <var>Y</var> is the minor version, and
          
          <var>Z</var> is the patch.
          When any next version is released, the corresponding version number (major, minor, or patch)
          is incremented, and numbers to the right are reset to 0.
          (The place value of the integer does not carry over. For example, the next Patch for
          <code>v1.4.9</code> would be <code>v1.4.10</code>, not <code>v1.5.0</code>.)
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Major Versions</h3>
          <p>
            Major versions incorporate new features that change the application or API in a
            non-backward-compatible, or breaking, way. On a website, this might include
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any semantic changes to content (the meaning of the content changes) to a lot of
              documents or large portion of the site.
            </li>
            <li>Any revamps of any systems, such as CSS architecture, grid layouts, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>,
              <em>that would necessitate a change in HTML or content</em>.
              If a system revamped but was handled automatically
              (<i lang="la"><abbr title="exampli gratia">e.g.</abbr></i>, the classnames stayed the same;
              only their definitions changed), this would not be a Major revision.
            </li>
            <li>Any <em>major</em> changes to look-and-feel. Though this would be considered an
              <i>unsemantic</i> revision, a major change to a site&rsquo;s appearance constitutes
              a new Major version number. The reasoning behind this is mostly psychological and
              helps users in some way probably.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Minor Versions</h3>
          <p>
            Minor versions incorporate new features that change the API in a backward-compatible,
            or non-breaking, way. In the world of front-end web development, this could include
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Anything added to the site that does not require changing a previously-defined aspect
              of the site.
            </li>
            <li>These are where most <i>bells and whistles</i> would be categorized.</li>
            <li>
              Also, any cleaning up or organizing code or source files,
              <i lang="la"><abbr title="exampli gratia">e.g.</abbr></i>, to improve efficiency/performance,
              would be considered a Minor feature, even though this does not add new functionality.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Patches</h3>
          <p>
            Patches incorporate backwards-compatible, non-breaking, bug fixes only.
            Do not release any new features in a Patch.
            In HTML/CSS/JS, this could mean
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Typo corrections in content and/or syntactical corrections in code</li>
            <li>Non-syntactic changes in code formatting (indents, newlines, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>)</li>
            <li>Minor changes to CSS styles / HTML Elements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Think of patches as the <em>quickest</em> way to fix something.
            Bug fixes do not necessarily hold efficiency/performance in high priortiy.

        <h2>Branching Model</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we got the introductory material out of the way, we can start talking about branching.
          This section describes my modifications to
          <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" rel="external">Vincent Driessen&rsquo;s 
            <cite>A Successful Git Branching Model</cite></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this branching model, there are five types of branches:
          <code>master</code>, <code>dev</code>, feature branches, hotfix branches, and staging branches.
        </p>
        <section id="master">
          <h3><code>master</code></h3>
          <p>The <code>master</code> branch is where the most up-to-date <em>released</em> version of the
            app lives. Users have read access to <code>master</code> and should be able to download any
            version, including old versions.
            Every commit on <code>master</code> corresponds to a stable release with a unique version number.
            The most recent commit on <code>master</code> corresponds to the most recent released version.
            <code>master</code> is never deleted.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="dev">
          <h3><code>dev</code></h3>
          <p>The <code>dev</code> branch represents the most up-to-date <em>unreleased</em> version of the app.
            All the completed fixes and features are committed to <code>dev</code>. There should be no
            works-in-progress; only the finished product of the fix/feature is committed.
            <code>dev</code> lives in parallel to <code>master</code>. At some point in time, the code on
            <code>dev</code> will eventually make its way onto <code>master</code> via a
            <a href="#stage">staging branch</a> (discussed below).
            <code>dev</code> is never deleted.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="feat">
          <h3>Feature Branches</h3>
          <p>A feature branch is branched off of <code>dev</code>, work is then done on the feature branch,
            and once the work and testing of the new feature is complete, the branch is merged back
            into <code>dev</code>, at which point the feature branch is deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feature branches are for works in progress of major or minor features for the next
            major or minor version. Though work on a feature branche may include bug fixes or patches
            for that particular feature, these branches are not for fixes/patches for the app itself.
          </p>
          <p>A feature branch begins with the prefix <code>feat-</code> and usually contains an issue number
            (if there is an issue on GitHub) and then some short descriptor.
            Example: <code>feat-17footnotes</code>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="fix">
          <h3>Fix Branches and <code>hotfix</code></h3>
          <p>A branch called <code>hotfix</code> is branched off of <code>master</code> and acts sort of like
            a development branch, but only for fixes, not new features.
            <code>hotfix</code> is likely to contain multiple fixes, and
            at some point in time when a patch version is ready to be released,
            <code>hotfix</code> is merged back into <code>master</code>
            <strong>creating a new Patch Version release</strong>, and then <code>hotfix</code> is deleted.
          </p>
          <p>Usually, individual fixes are small enough to be their own commits on <code>hotfix</code>,
            so the commit history of this branch is linear.
            However sometimes fixes are too large for one commit, and they need their own sub-branch.
            Thus we use fix branches.
          </p>
          <p>Fix branches branches are branched off of <code>hotfix</code>,
            much like <a href="#feature">feature branches</a> are branched off of <code>dev</code>.
            The difference is fix branches are used for fixing small bugs and errors instead of
            introducing new features.
            When work is complete for the fix, the branch merges back into <code>hotfix</code> and
            is then deleted.
          </p>
          <p>Fix branches begin with prefix <code>fix-</code> and usually contain an issue number
            (if there is an issue on GitHub) and then some short descriptor.
            Example: <code>fix-13sprites</code>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="stage">
          <h3>Staging Branches</h3>
          <p>
            The staging branches are a bit of a mix between feature and hotfix branches.
            At some point in development when a release (say v3.2.0) has been determined
            //- (this usually happens when a Milestone is closed),
            a staging branch <code>stage-v3.2.0</code> branches off of <code>dev</code>.
            From this point on, no further feature branches are to be merged into <code>stage-v3.2.0</code>,
            no new features are to be added, and no development on features is to be made.
            The purpose of staging branches is only to make small fixes and corrections,
            setting the &hellip; ahem &hellip; <i>stage</i> for release of version v3.2.0.
            Meanwhile, <code>dev</code> can continue progressing while the features for v3.2.0 are locked.
          </p>
          <p>When v3.2.0 is ready to be released, <code>stage-v3.2.0</code> is merged into <code>master</code>,
            <strong>creating a new Minor (or Major) release</strong>, and then <code>stage-v3.2.0</code>
            is deleted.
          </p>
          <p>Staging branches begin with <code>stage-</code> and end with a version number.
            Example: <code>stage-v3.2.0</code>.

          <h3>Single Issue Examples</h3>
          <p>Required Labels for GitHub issues. These are mutually-exclusive (an issue must have exactly one of these).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>`feature-hotfix`: A request to fix a bug (not really a feature).</li>
            <li>`feature-minor` : A request to add a minor feature.</li>
            <li>`feature-major` : A request to add a major feature.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Optional Labels. Mutually-exclusive labels are grouped in brackets.</p>
          <pre>[`priority-high` | `priority-medium` | `priority-low` | `priority-wontfix`] || [`layer-HTML` | `layer-CSS` | `layer-JS`] || `question` || `duplicate`</pre>
          <p>Issues are also assigned to GitHub Milestones. Milestones are named after expected future release version numbers.</p>
          <p>
            Good developers will address the bugs first, then the minor issues, then the major issues.
            This is the typical priority order. Of course, work can be done on all three at the same time but
            it's best to finalize the bugfixes first.
          </p>
          <section>
            <h4>Single Bug Example</h4>
            <p>
              Let's say you're working on a project and you're at some point in time at which the project is 100% stable:
              there are no bugs, and no new features to be added. You have two branches, <code>master</code> and <code>dev</code>,
              which live parallel alongside each other.
            </p>
            <p>A developer or user notices a bug in the current version (latest release on <code>master</code>).
              This could be a syntactic error, run-time error, or semantic error. They submit a new GitHub Issue,
              say *#5: background image missing*. This issue would be given the label `feature-hotfix` and
              assigned to a GitHub Milestone with a patch version number.
              Then a developer creates the branch a new branch `fix-5bgimg` off of <code>hotfix</code> (which is already
              branched off <code>master</code>).
              Developers do work on this branch, and when it is fixed, close the issue or submit a pull request.
              When the project manager sees the closed issue/pull request, `fix-5bgimg` is merged back into
              <code>hotfix</code> and then `fix-5bgimg` is deleted.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Minor Feature Example</h4>
            <p>Same situation as before, stable project.</p>
            <p>
              Then either a developer or user requests a new minor feature, say a new color scheme, and submits a new
              GitHub Issue called *#13: new color scheme*.
              Because a new color scheme is a new feature that wouldn't require any changing of previous functionality,
              it will be given the label `feature-minor`. It would also be assigned to a GitHub Milestone with a minor version number.
              A developer creates a new branch called `feat-13colorscheme` off <code>dev</code>.
              Developers do work on the branch, and when they decide it is complete, they close the GitHub Issue
              or submit a pull request. The branch is not merged until the project manager sees the
              closed issue/pull request and decides to merge it back into <code>dev</code>. When `feat-13colorscheme`
              is merged back into <code>dev</code>, the feature branch is deleted.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Major Feature Example</h4>
            <p>
              Major features are difficult because they are long-term features and typically take more time to
              complete than minor features do. In addition, major features aren't as frequently released, and
              they aren't typically released one at a time. It is usually the case that a bunch of major features
              are released all together, so that the number of non-backward-compatible changes is minimized.
              Thus it takes careful consideration of how and when to release major versions of an app.
              This section describes a model example of a major feature.
            </p>
            <p>Same situation as before, stable project.</p>
            <p>
              A developer or user requests a new major feature and submits a new GitHub Issue. The Issue would be
              assigned to a Milestone with a major version number.
            </p>
            <p>A major feature branch is very similar to a minor feature branch. It would be branched off <code>dev</code>,
              and when complete, the GitHub Issue would be closed. However since major features are more slowly
              released than minor features, it wouldn't make sense to merge this feature into <code>dev</code>:
              if so, the latest unreleased version of the project would contain a bunch of minor features and perhaps
              one major feature. In this case, the next released version would have to be a major release, even if
              there is only one major feature introduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we want our next scheduled release to be a minor release, we don't want any major features
              introduced into the <code>dev</code> branch, even if the major feature is complete.
              Instead, we should branch a **development branch** <code>dev-v4</code> off
              of <code>dev</code> and merge the major feature branch into the new development branch.
            </p>
          </section>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Release Examples</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Patch Release Example</h4>
            <p>Same situation as before, stable project. Say the project's latest release is v3.2.1.</p>
            <p>Patches are released only when bugs on <code>master</code> have been fixed via the <code>hotfix</code> branch.
              At some point in time, *Milestone v3.2.2* will be closed. This happens when all
              the Issues in the Milestone are closed. At this point, if all the fixes and bugs have been worked out,
              <code>hotfix</code> is merged into <code>master</code>, creating v3.2.2.
              Then <code>master</code> is merged into <code>dev</code> (and any existing release branches).
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Minor Release Example</h4>
            <p>Same situation as before, stable project. Say the project's latest release is v3.2.1.</p>
            <p>When a minor feature Issue is closed, that feature branch is most likely merged into <code>dev</code> and
              *Milestone v3.3.0* is closer to being complete. When all the Issues for the
              Milestone are closed, the Milestone itself is closed. At this point, `rel-v3.3.0` is branched
              off <code>dev</code> and only fixes and bugs for v3.3.0 may be committed to `rel-v3.3.0`.
              Any new features will be committed to a development branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The time at which Version 3.3.0 is released is probably dependent on a deadline. Beforehand,
              any changes to <code>master</code> (namely, hotfixes) should be merged into <code>dev</code> and `rel-v3.3.0`
              as previously mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>When Version 3.3.0 is ready to be released, `rel-v3.3.0` is merged into <code>master</code> and then
              <code>master</code> is merged into <code>dev</code> (and any other existing release branches).

            <h4>Major Release Example</h4>
            <p>Same situation as before, stable project. Say the project's latest release is v3.2.1.</p>
            <p>
              When a major feature Issue is closed, that feature branch is most likely merged into the next
              major development branch, e.g., <code>dev-v4</code>. When all the issues for *Milestone v4.0.0* are closed,
              the Milestone itself is closed.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point, regardless of whether there are any active hotfix or release branches,
              <code>dev-v4</code> is merged into <code>dev</code>, <code>dev-v4</code> is deleted, and a new branch `rel-v4.0.0` is branched
              off of <code>dev</code>. (Remember, the development branch <code>dev-v4</code> is where major work can be done and features can be added. In contrast, the release branch `rel-v4.0.0` is only for bugfixes. Once `rel-v4.0.0` is branched off <code>dev</code>, work can be done on <code>dev</code> for the next Minor release, namely, v4.1.0.)
            </p>
            <p>
              The work on any existing hotfix branches and release branches continues as normal, merging into
              <code>master</code> when appropriate. Then any changes to <code>master</code> are merged into <code>dev</code> and `rel-v4.0.0`
              as previously mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Version 4.0.0 is ready to be released, which is probably due to a deadline, `rel-v4.0.0` is
              merged into <code>master</code> and then <code>master</code> is merged into <code>dev</code> (and any other existing release branches).
