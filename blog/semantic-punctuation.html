the Web. First and foremost, <strong>punctuation should be used to mark up text</strong>. The
meaning we give to textual elements in the written language is primarily conveyed through
punctuation, and if that fails, we turn to HTML. This isn&rsquo;t to say HTML is bad and that
we shouldn&rsquo;t use it, but there is a line between not enough markup and too much markup.</p><p data-informative="">Let me ask you this: do you find yourself trying to decide whether to wrap a question
with something like <code>&lt;i class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;</code>? After all, a question
does indicate a change of tone (the <code>i</code> Element). Imagine having to type the code
for each and every question, and don&rsquo;t forget about adding
<code>.question::after {content: '?';}</code> to the CSS. No, we would rather simply type a
question mark in the document. Now imagine having to mark up every sentence with
<code>&lt;sntc&gt;</code> tag, or even worse, every word with <code>&lt;word&gt;</code>.</p><p data-informative="">Truth be told, question marks, periods, and spaces give meaning to the sentences and
words we write. Likewise, we should make the best use we can of spaces, commas, apostrophes,
stops (including periods, question marks, and exclamation marks) hyphens, colons, dashes,
ellipses, semicolons, quotation marks, and any other punctuation characters at our disposal,
as we normally would on a typewriter.</p><p data-informative="">Without further ado, the number-one rule is this:
<strong>if you can use punctuation to mark up text-level content, <em>do it</em></strong>.
Save yourself the time and effort on
trying to decide on an HTML Element and just write naturally (as long as you consistently
adhere to some prescribed manual of style&mdash;another post for another day). After that is
all said and done, then it would be time to turn to the HTML Elements we know and love.</p><p>This document is not meant to be a comprehensive manual for the written English
language, so it is left to the discrection of the author (and/or his employer) to decide how to
use punctuation.</p><section class="c-Document__Released" id="punct-common" data-status="released"><h2>Common Punctuation</h2><del class="-d-bk" datetime="2015-06-15 21:40"><section class="c-Document__Released" id="apostrophe" data-status="released"><h3>The Apostrophe</h3><p>Normal and efficient typing would dictate that apostrophes, in both possessive

or <code>&amp;rsquo;</code>) as it is more typographically appropriate.
This has been the consensus of the Unicode committee, but
<a href="https://tedclancy.wordpress.com/2015/06/03/which-unicode-character-should-represent-the-english-apostrophe-and-why-the-unicode-committee-is-very-wrong/">opponents have been slowly gaining support</a>.</p><p>The prevailing argument is that since <b>U+2019</b> is technically a punctuation mark, which
separates words, contractions and possessions are incorrectly interpreted as two separate
words. This is simply not the case: the word <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> is not two words
<i>doesn</i> and <i>t</i>, it&rsquo;s one single word
(albeit a contraction of the two words <i>does</i> and <i>not</i>).
Instead of using a punctuation mark, we should be using
a letter-like symbol because it becomes part of the word.</p><p>Perhaps a more convincing argument is that a right single quotation mark used as an
apostrophe <em>does not have an opening quotation mark</em>. This causes problems in many
text editors that pair delimiters, and word processors that have the ability to select text
word-by-word. In the latter case, for example, double-clicking the <i>o</i> in
<i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> would select <i>doesn</i>, not the entire word. This is because the word
treats the right single quotation mark as the end of a quoted phrase.</p><p>Opponents submit that the correct encoding should be <b>U+02BC Modifier Letter Apostrophe (&#x02bc;)</b>,
which appears identical to the right single quotation mark.</p><p>It is difficult to gain support, though.
The Unicode committee says this character should be reserved for apostrophes representing
modifier letters,
<a cite="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch06.pdf">for example, in transliterations to indicate a glottal stop</a>.
Furthermore, there is simply no
easy keyboard shortcut for this character, and no HTML entity shorthand name. To mark it up,
one must type <code>&amp;#x02bc;</code>.</p><figure class="crossgrid-lined">The word <i>I&apos;m</i> is a contraction with a regular Apostrophe,
while the word <i>Cody&rsquo;s</i> is a possessive noun that uses the
Right Single Quotation Mark. The Modifier Letter Apostrophe, which does not break words
but rather is treated as part of a word, is shown in the possessive plural
<i>children&#x02bc;s</i>.</figure><p>It is this author&rsquo;s opinion that there must be some middle ground. The
<b>U+2019</b> is too far to the left, as the apostrophe is not used for
quoting material, but the <b>U+02BC</b> is too far to the right, as the
apostrophe is not used as a letter of the alphabet or to indicate pronounciation.
I think there should be a third option&mdash;dare I suggest it be named the
<i>Punctuation Apostrophe</i>&mdash;but perhaps it will be a very long time until the Unicode
committee decides on a solution.</p><p>For the time being, we must stick to the convention they have prescribed.
<strong>Use <b>U+2019 Right Single Quotation Mark</b> for apostrophes in contractions and possessions.</strong></p></section></section></ins><section class="c-Document__Released" id="quotes" data-status="released"><h3>The Quotation Mark</h3><p>The <b>quotation mark</b> has many uses.
Most people use it in plain text (think email, <i lang="la">circa</i> <time>1996</time>) to
show emphasis or importance,
indicate a change in tone or voice,
mark up an idiomatic expression or phrase, or
highlight key words.
When text formatting isn&rsquo;t available, people have to revert to
punctuation to semantically mark up elements&mdash;the whole point of this article.</p><p>In a quick-and-dirty setting such as one listed above, use the
normal quotation mark character by typing
<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">&apos;</kbd></kbd>.
This produces an <i>ambidexterous</i> quotation mark and doesn&rsquo;t look too pretty
from a typographical point of view.</p><p>In formal documents such as technical reports and blog posts,
use proper <b>left and right double-quote</b> entities
(<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">&#x005b;</kbd></kbd> and
<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">&#x005b;</kbd></kbd>,
or <code>&amp;ldquo;</code> and <code>&amp;rdquo;</code>)

In the case of an
actual quotation (spoken by a person, fictional or not), use the <code>q</code> Element,
possibly with the <code>[cite</code>] attribute. In the case of
<a rel="this" href="#scare-mention">scare quotes and mentions</a>,
use the <code>i</code> Element with appropriate CSS.</p><p>There is one more thing worth mentioning: if you must <b>escape</b> the
quotation mark character, the HTML entity is <code>&amp;quot;</code>. Use this only
when demonstrating code in an example or figure. Otherwise, just use the
normal quotation mark character.</p></section></section><section id="punct-pauses"><h2>Pauses and Interruptions</h2><section class="c-Document__Draft" id="comma" data-status="draft"><h3>The Comma</h3></section><section class="c-Document__Complete" id="colon" data-status="complete"><h3>The Colon</h3><p>A colon separates a complete sentence and a list or example.

(<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">-</kbd></kbd> or <code>&amp;ndash;</code>).
En dashes indicate an inclusive range of numbers and could be replaced by the

close to be separate sentences. There should be a complete clause on each side of the
semicolon, and there should not be a conjunction immediately following the semicolon.
A correct usage followed by an incorrect usage is shown below.</p><figure class="crossgrid-lined">Nationally, the ratio is about 800 students per administrator; Maine is about 400 to 1, suggesting a waste of funds.<figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">The first and second clauses are sufficiently closely related that they

phrases with commas. In this case, using commas to separate big list items as well as
smaller list items is too confusing, so the semicolon makes a distinction.</p><figure class="crossgrid-lined">Your essay should contain five paragraphs: an introduction, which contains a thesis statement and establishes three points; three body paragraphs, one for each point; and a conclusion, or summary.<figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">The directions contain three list items, but each list item contains

the list items.</figcaption></figure></section><section class="c-Document__Complete" id="ellipsis" data-status="complete"><h3>The Ellipsis</h3><p>Contrary to its appearance, the ellipsis is one character. It is not three periods
in a row, nor is it three periods separated by spaces. The
ellipsis<sup><a class="Rf" id="rf-ellipses" rel="this" href="#fn-ellipses">1</a></sup>
can be accessed
via <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox c-Key">;</kbd></kbd>, or the character
entity <code>&amp;hellip;</code> in HTML. It is convention to insert a single space before and
after each ellipsis, therefore treating it as a normal word or group of words.</p><p>There are two main uses of the ellipsis. The first, which
may be used in formal writing, is within quoted material. (In HTML, direct quotes should be
contained in a <code>q</code> Element or <code>blockquote</code> Element, depending on a number
of variables.) Within a directly-quoted passage, an ellipsis indicates an omission of material
that was present in the original quotation, but removed in the written reproduction for various
purposes. These reasons might include making the reproduction more consise or more understandable.
In any case, the quote must maintain grammatical sense and it must maintain its original semantics.</p><p>The second use of the ellipsis is more informal than the first, and as such, the
rules for using it are much less strict. In informal writing (such as emails or text messages),
the ellipsis may be used to indicate a pause or break in the writer&rsquo;s train of
thought&mdash;much like a dash. In contrast with the dash, though, the ellipsis indicates a stronger
or longer pause, which might be
<q cite="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/chicago-style.aspx">accompanied by confusion, insecurity, distress, or uncertainty.</q>
<q cite="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/ellipses?page=1">Dashes &hellip; should be reserved for more &hellip; decisive pauses.</q>
One final contrast is that the dash
should not be surrounded by spaces, while the ellipsis should.</p><footer><ul class="c-ListFootnotes"><li><sup><a class="Fn" id="fn-ellipses" rel="this" href="#rf-ellipses">1</a></sup>

parenthesis. Together, these two parentheses separate the aside from the surrounding prose.</p><p>The phrase inside the parentheses is extraneous information (which means it
could be removed without disrupting the flow of prose or changing its meaning). The
sentence you just read was a bad example of using parentheses because the remark inside
was integral to the sentence (it explained what <i>extraneous information</i>
meant). That last one was okay, though. When deciding whether to use parentheses,
<q>Is this information a necessary part of the sentence?</q>
If not, it&rsquo;s okay to place it in parentheses.</p><figure class="crossgrid-lined">They fled through the woods, and then found George (dear, sweet George
the accountant) lying dead in the creek.</figure></section><section id="emdash-phrase"><h3>Dashes: Part Two</h3><p>The em dash&mdash;apart from indicating a pause&mdash;can also be used with
a twin to indicate asides. In contrast to parentheses, dashes are used to highlight
a phrase and bring it to the reader&rsquo;s attention. Remember, dashes are dramatic.
If the aside were removed, the sentence would convey a different mood because that
information removed would no longer be worth any attention.</p><p>The first sentence in the preceeding paragraph uses a pair of em dashes to
highlight the fact that em dashes have another function: they may indicate a pause.
Re-read the sentence without the aside
(<q cite="#emdash-phrase">The em dash can also be used with a twin&hellip;</q>)
and see how the meaning changes.</p><p>Again, the dashes should be adjacent to the words inside and out. There
should be no immediate spaces or punctuation next to the dash.</p><figure class="crossgrid-lined">They fled through the woods, and then George&mdash;dear, sweet George
the accountant&mdash;jumped out and stabbed them.</figure></section><section id="comma2"><h3>Commas: Part Two</h3><p>There are just too many rules about commas, so I won&rsquo;t talk about
them all. But below are a few examples of when commas can be used to separate a clause
from a sentence.</p><section><h4>Appositives</h4><figure class="crossgrid-lined">My first dog, Axel, was found astray.</figure><p>Axel&rsquo;s name is unnecessarily included because I can only have one
first dog. Thus we surround his name with commas.
His name and the commas may be removed without changing the
sentence&rsquo;s semantics. A counterexample would be, <q>My dog Axel was found astray.</q>
If I have more than one dog, I need to clarify which one was found astray
in this case. I can&rsquo;t surround his name with commas.</p></section><section><h4>Nonrestrictive Clauses</h4><figure class="crossgrid-lined">Diamonds, which are expensive, aren&rsquo;t something I buy often.</figure><p>All diamonds are expensive, so there&rsquo;s no need to indicate this in
the sentence. The commas indicate the clause is unnecessary.
Remove the phrase and commas and the meaning stays the same. On the
other hand, <i>Diamonds that are found in the ocean are very rare</i> is not
a nonrestrictive clause (it&rsquo;s a restrictive clause) because it distinguishes
diamonds that are found in the ocean from other diamonds. We can&rsquo;t surround
the clause <q cite="#comma2">that are found in the ocean</q> with commas.</p><ins class="-d-bk" datetime="2015-04-30 15:25"><p>One general rule of thumb is that nonrestrictive causes (with commas) contain the word
<i>which</i>, and restrictive clauses (without commas) contain the word <i>that</i>.
Of course, this rule is very lax and there are many exceptions.</p></ins></section></section></section><footer class="c-Document__Draft" data-status="draft"><h1>References</h1><ul><li itemprop="citation">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/colons</li><li itemprop="citation">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dashes-colons-and-commas</li><li itemprop="citation">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dashes-parentheses-and-commas</li><li itemprop="citation">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/ellipses</li><li itemprop="citation">http://conventionallanguage.blogspot.com/2008/07/4-semicolon-colon-dash-hyphen-and.html</li><li itemprop="citation">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/566/01/</li><li itemprop="citation">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/604/01/</li></ul></footer></div></main><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js" integrity="sha256-BbhdlvQf/xTY9gja0Dq3HiwQF8LaCRTXxZKRutelT44=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script></body></html>
