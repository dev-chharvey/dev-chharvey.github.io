<p class="c-Lede  c-Lede--dropcap">This document provides suggested use for punctuation symbols when writing for
  the Web. First and foremost, <strong>punctuation should be used to mark up text.</strong> The
  meaning we give to textual elements in the written language is primarily conveyed through
  punctuation, and if that fails, we turn to HTML. This isn&rsquo;t to say HTML is bad and that
  we shouldn&rsquo;t use it, but there is a line between not enough markup and too much markup.</p>
<p data-informative="">Let me ask you this: do you find yourself trying to decide whether to wrap a question
  with something like <code>&lt;i class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;</code>? After all, a question
  does indicate a change of tone (the <code>i</code> Element). Imagine having to type the code
  for each and every question, and don&rsquo;t forget about adding
  <code>.question::after {content: '?';}</code> to the CSS. No, we would rather simply type a
  question mark in the document. Now imagine having to mark up every sentence with
  <code>&lt;sntc&gt;</code> tag, or even worse, every word with <code>&lt;word&gt;</code>.</p>
<p data-informative="">Truth be told, question marks, periods, and spaces give meaning to the sentences and
  words we write. Likewise, we should make the best use we can of spaces, commas, apostrophes,
  stops (including periods, question marks, and exclamation marks) hyphens, colons, dashes,
  ellipses, semicolons, quotation marks, and any other punctuation characters at our disposal,
  as we normally would on a typewriter.</p>
<p data-informative="">Without further ado, the number-one rule is this: <strong>if you can use punctuation
  to mark up text-level content, <em>do it</em></strong>. Save yourself the time and effort on
  trying to decide on an HTML Element and just write naturally (as long as you consistently
  adhere to some prescribed manual of style&mdash;another post for another day). After that is
  all said and done, then it would be time to turn to the HTML Elements we know and love.</p>
<p>This document is not meant to be a comprehensive manual for the written English
  language, so it is left to the discrection of the author (and/or his employer) to decide how to
  use punctuation.</p>
<section id="punct-common" class="c-Document__Released" data-status="released">
  <h2>Common Punctuation</h2>
  <section>
    <h3>The Apostrophe</h3>
    <p>Normal and efficient typing would dictate that apostrophes, in both possessive
      nouns and contractions, use the apostrophe key on the keyboard (next to the
      <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">return</kbd></kbd> key). However, in very formal documents, such as those
      presented to peers or those soon to be published (in a blog, for example), authors are
      encouraged to use the <b>right single-quote</b> entity
      (<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">]</kbd></kbd>
      or <code>&amp;rsquo;</code>) as it is more typographically appropriate. See the
      examples below for differences in rendering.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">The word <i>I'm</i> is a contraction with a regular apostrophe,
      while the word <i>Cody&rsquo;s</i> is a possessive noun that uses the right
      single-quote character. Notice the difference in characters.</figure>
    <p>Use the regular apostrophe character (<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">'</kbd></kbd>) in
      non-normative documents, drafts, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>
      Also use it in code as another type of string
      delimiter. The <code>&amp;apos;</code> entity in HTML should only be used to escape
      the apostrophe character in an example of code.</p>
    <figure>
      <figcaption class="c-Caption">The following snippet of HTML instructs authors how to
        use apostrophes in JavaScript code.</figcaption>
      <pre>&lt;p&gt; To get a pop-up, call
  &lt;code&gt; alert( <u>&amp;apos;</u> Hello, world. <u>&amp;apos;</u> ); &lt;/code&gt;
  in the event. &lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    </figure>
  </section>
  <section id="quotes">
    <h3>The Quotation Mark</h3>
    <p>The <b>quotation mark</b> has many uses.
      Most people use it in plain text (think email, <i lang="la">circa</i> <time>1996</time>) to
      show emphasis or importance,
      indicate a change in tone or voice,
      mark up an idiomatic expression or phrase, or
      highlight key words.
      When text formatting isn&rsquo;t available, people have to revert to
      punctuation to semantically mark up elements&mdash;the whole point of this article.</p>
    <p>In a quick-and-dirty setting such as one listed above, use the
      normal quotation mark character by typing
      <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">'</kbd></kbd>.
      This produces an <i>ambidexterous</i> quotation mark and doesn&rsquo;t look too pretty
      from a typographical point of view.
    <p>In formal documents such as technical reports and blog posts,
      use proper <b>left and right double-quote</b> entities
      (<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">[</kbd></kbd> and
      <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">[</kbd></kbd>,
      or <code>&amp;ldquo;</code> and <code>&amp;rdquo;</code>)
      when you need to surround a phrase with quotation marks, for whatever reason.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      <p>&quot;This sentence is surrounded with ambidexterous quotation mark characters.&quot;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;This sentence is surrounded with the left double and right double quotation mark characters.&rdquo;</p>
    </figure>
    <p>In most cases though, these entities will not be needed. In the case of an
      actual quotation (spoken by a person, fictional or not), use the <code>q</code> Element,
      possibly with the <code>[cite]</code> attribute. In the case of
      <a rel="this" href="#scare-mention">scare quotes and mentions</a>,
      use the <code>i</code> Element with appropriate CSS.</p>
    <p>There is one more thing worth mentioning: if you must <b>escape</b> the
      quotation mark character, the HTML entity is <code>&amp;quot;</code>. Use this only
      when demonstrating code in an example or figure. Otherwise, just use the
      normal quotation mark character.</p>

<section id="punct-pauses">
  <h2>Pauses and Interruptions</h2>
  <section id="comma" class="c-Document__Draft" data-status="draft">
    <h3>The Comma</h3>
  </section>
  <section id="colon" class="c-Document__Complete" data-status="complete">
    <h3>The Colon</h3>
    <p>A colon separates a complete sentence and a list or example. See the figure
      below.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      <p>The following sentence is correct: <q>I have two favorite hobbies: reading and writing.</q></p>
      <p>An incorrect usage would be: <q>My two favorite hobbies are: reading and writing.</q></p>
    </figure>
    <p>In general, a colon can almost always be replaced with the word
      <i>namely</i>.</p>
    <p>A colon usually precedes a list or some sort of enumeration, either
      implicitly (in prose) or explicitly (via an actual bulleted or numbered list). Colons
      can also precede an example or illustration. See the introduction of each example above.</p>
    <p>The first letter of the first word following a colon is usually not capitalized.
      There are two exceptions: if the list items in a bulleted list that follow are capitalized,
      and if the colon separates a title and subtitle of, for example, a book.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="emdash" class="c-Document__Complete" data-status="complete">
    <h3>The Dash</h3>
    <p>When unspecified, the word <i>dash</i> almost always refers to the
      <b>em dash</b>
      (<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">shift</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">-</kbd></kbd>
      or <code>&amp;mdash;</code> in HTML).</p>
    <p>The single dash, like the colon, can be used to indicate a pause or
      interruption in prose. However, dashes are stronger and more informal than colons.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      I have two hobbies: cooking and cleaning.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">This example could be read, <q>I have two
        hobbies, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you what they are. Cooking and
        cleaning.</q></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      I have two hobbies&mdash;cooking and cleaning.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">This one could be read, <q>I have two
        hobbies. Wait for it, wait for it. Cooking and cleaning!</q> This is not a good
        use of the em dash.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      When we boarded the plane, we realized we only forgot one thing&mdash;the baby.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">This is a more appropriate use of the em dash.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t use dashes for the boring or mundane. Dashes are dramatic. Also,
      notice the lack of spaces surrounding the dash. This is the common practice.</p>
    <p>Dashes are not hyphens. Hyphens (found next to the <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">0</kbd></kbd>)
      are used for compound words and a bunch of other stuff that I&rsquo;m not really sure
      about. But they don&rsquo;t indicate pauses. The same goes for <b>en dashes</b>
      (<kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">-</kbd></kbd> or <code>&amp;ndash;</code>).
      En dashes indicate an inclusive range of numbers and could be replaced by the
      word <i>to</i>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="semicolon" class="c-Document__Complete" data-status="complete">
    <h3>The Semicolon</h3>
    <p>Use a semicolon to combine two closely related clauses: clauses that are too
      close to be separate sentences. There should be a complete clause on each side of the
      semicolon, and there should not be a conjunction immediately following the semicolon.
      A correct usage followed by an incorrect usage is shown below.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      Nationally, the ratio is about 800 students per administrator; Maine is about 400 to 1,
      suggesting a waste of funds.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">The first and second clauses are sufficiently closely related
        that they should be in the same sentence.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      The national ratio of students to administrators is about 800 to 1; however in
      Maine the ratio is lower, suggesting a waste of funds.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">In this example, the semicolon should be replaced
        with a comma or a period.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Semicolons are also sometimes used to separate phrases that may contain smaller
      phrases with commas. In this case, using commas to separate big list items as well as
      smaller list items is too confusing, so the semicolon makes a distinction.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">
      Your essay should contain five paragraphs: an introduction, which contains a thesis statement
      and establishes three points; three body paragraphs, one for each point; and a conclusion,
      or summary.
      <figcaption class="c-Caption c-Caption--after">The directions contain three list items, but each list item
        contains non-restrictive clauses, which use commas. Thus semicolons are used to separate
        the list items.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>
  <section id="ellipsis" class="c-Document__Complete" data-status="complete">
    <h3>The Ellipsis</h3>
    <p>Contrary to its appearance, the ellipsis is one character. It is not three periods
      in a row, nor is it three periods separated by spaces. The ellipsis<sup><a class="Rf"
      id="rf-ellipses" rel="this" href="#fn-ellipses">1</a></sup> can be accessed
      via <kbd><kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">option</kbd> + <kbd class="o-Textbox  c-Key">;</kbd></kbd>, or the character
      entity <code>&amp;hellip;</code> in HTML. It is convention to insert a single space before and
      after each ellipsis, therefore treating it as a normal word or group of words.</p>
    <p>There are two main uses of the ellipsis. The first, which
      may be used in formal writing, is within quoted material. (In HTML, direct quotes should be
      contained in a <code>q</code> Element or <code>blockquote</code> Element, depending on a number
      of variables.) Within a directly-quoted passage, an ellipsis indicates an omission of material
      that was present in the original quotation, but removed in the written reproduction for various
      purposes. These reasons might include making the reproduction more consise or more understandable.
      In any case, the quote must maintain grammatical sense and it must maintain its original semantics.</p>
    <p>The second use of the ellipsis is more informal than the first, and as such, the
      rules for using it are much less strict. In informal writing (such as emails or text messages),
      the ellipsis may be used to indicate a pause or break in the writer&rsquo;s train of
      thought&mdash;much like a dash. In contrast with the dash, though, the ellipsis indicates a stronger
      or longer pause, which might be <q cite="http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/chicago-style.aspx">accompanied
      by confusion, insecurity, distress, or uncertainty.</q>
      <q cite="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/ellipses?page=1">Dashes &hellip;
      should be reserved for more &hellip; decisive pauses.</q> One final contrast is that the dash
      should not be surrounded by spaces, while the ellipsis should.</p>

      <ul class="c-ListFootnotes">
        <li>
          <sup><a class="Fn" id="fn-ellipses" rel="this" href="#rf-ellipses">1</a></sup>
          The plural form of a singular ellipsis is <i>ellipses</i>, not to be confused with the homonyn

<section id="punct-phrases" class="c-Document__Complete" data-status="complete">
  <h2>Separated Phrases</h2>
  <section id="parens">
    <h3>Parentheses</h3>
    <p>A single open parenthesis begins an aside and is always paired with a closing
      parenthesis. Together, these two parentheses separate the aside from the surrounding prose.</p>
    <p>The phrase inside the parentheses is extraneous information (which means it
      could be removed without disrupting the flow of prose or changing its meaning). The
      sentence you just read was a bad example of using parentheses because the remark inside
      was integral to the sentence (it explained what <i>extraneous information</i>
      meant). That last one was okay, though. When deciding whether to use parentheses,
      <q>Is this information a necessary part of the sentence?</q>
      If not, it&rsquo;s okay to place it in parentheses.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">They fled through the woods, and then found George (dear, sweet George
      the accountant) lying dead in the creek.</figure>
  </section>
  <section id="emdash-phrase">
    <h3>Dashes: Part Two</h3>
    <p>The em dash&mdash;apart from indicating a pause&mdash;can also be used with
      a twin to indicate asides. In contrast to parentheses, dashes are used to highlight
      a phrase and bring it to the reader&rsquo;s attention. Remember, dashes are dramatic.
      If the aside were removed, the sentence would convey a different mood because that
      information removed would no longer be worth any attention.</p>
    <p>The first sentence in the preceeding paragraph uses a pair of em dashes to
      highlight the fact that em dashes have another function: they may indicate a pause.
      Re-read the sentence without the aside (<q cite="#emdash-phrase">The em dash can also
      be used with a twin&hellip;</q>) and see how the meaning changes.</p>
    <p>Again, the dashes should be adjacent to the words inside and out. There
      should be no immediate spaces or punctuation next to the dash.</p>
    <figure class="crossgrid-lined">They fled through the woods, and then George&mdash;dear, sweet George
      the accountant&mdash;jumped out and stabbed them.</figure>
  </section>
  <section id="comma2">
    <h3>Commas: Part Two</h3>
    <p>There are just too many rules about commas, so I won&rsquo;t talk about
      them all. But below are a few examples of when commas can be used to separate a clause
      from a sentence.</p>
    <section>
      <h4>Appositives</h4>
      <figure class="crossgrid-lined">My first dog, Axel, was found astray.</figure>
      <p>Axel&rsquo;s name is unnecessarily included because I can only have one
        first dog. Thus we surround his name with commas.
        His name and the commas may be removed without changing the
        sentence&rsquo;s semantics. A counterexample would be, <q>My dog Axel was found astray.</q>
        If I have more than one dog, I need to clarify which one was found astray
        in this case. I can&rsquo;t surround his name with commas.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>Nonrestrictive Clauses</h4>
      <figure class="crossgrid-lined">Diamonds, which are expensive, aren&rsquo;t something I buy often.</figure>
      <p>All diamonds are expensive, so there&rsquo;s no need to indicate this in
        the sentence. The commas indicate the clause is unnecessary.
        Remove the phrase and commas and the meaning stays the same. On the
        other hand, <i>Diamonds that are found in the ocean are very rare</i> is not
        a nonrestrictive clause (it&rsquo;s a restrictive clause) because it distinguishes
        diamonds that are found in the ocean from other diamonds. We can&rsquo;t surround
        the clause <q cite="#comma2">that are found in the ocean</q> with commas.</p>
      <ins datetime="2015-04-30 15:25" style="display:block;">
      <p>One general rule of thumb is that nonrestrictive causes (with commas) contain the word
        <i>which</i>, and restrictive clauses (without commas) contain the word <i>that</i>.
        Of course, this rule is very lax and there are many exceptions.</p>
