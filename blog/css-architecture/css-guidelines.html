        <h1>Designers need a prototype; developers need a styleguide.</h1>
        <p>A prototype is not a styleguide. A prototype is a 
          <q><i lang="la">lorum ipsum</i></q> sample
          site, which is great for other developers and stakeholders to get a feel for the site,
          but not all we as developers need. We need a styleguide to isolate each component and
          narrow down our requirements. A styleguide also helps group similar components together so
          we can strip down the <i>similar but not identical</i> elements. A styleguide is like a
          <i>kitchen sink</i>. It looks nothing like a sample page but it has everything the sample
          page needs.

        <h1>Stylesheet order really does matter.</h1>
        <p>
          While it may sometimes seem logical to write your CSS to match the DOM, it actually
          hinders long-term development. Your stylesheet should be an <a href="">inverted triangle</a>,
          starting with very generic and far-reaching selectors, moving to very explicit, localized
          selectors, and finally ending with trumps and hacks. This makes development much more
          maintainable in the long run for many reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Specificity is kept as low as possible and is much easier to override later on.
            Throughout the stylesheet, specificity increases, never (hardly ever) decreases.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are grouping similar components together, not components that just so happen to
            live next to each other in the DOM.
          </li>
          <li>Any future additions to the CSS has a predictable place, and future removals are easier to find.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Why does this matter? Reusability. You can reuse a <code>.main-link</code> anytime you want.
          You can&rsquo;t necessarily put a <code>header &gt; nav#menu ul li a</code> anywhere on the page.
        </p>

        <h1>Documentation should be directly in the CSS as comments.</h1>
        <p>
          Unfortunately there is no equivalent to JavaDoc for CSS
          (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4947213/does-anyone-know-of-a-css-documentation-tool">although some proposals have been made</a>).
          That doesn&rsquo;t mean you and your team can&rsquo;t agree on some commenting convention.
          Generally, there should be 3 levels of comments:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>architecturally</strong>: table of contents and headers for <i>sections</i> of CSS source code</li>
          <li><strong>component-wise</strong>: each object, component, or <i>thing</i> on a page has a class
            that deserves its own comment, explaining when, how, and why it should be used.
          </li>
          <li><strong>developer-level</strong>: small, one-line comments explaining why something was done.
            Always do this when you use <code>!important</code>, but you can also do this for code that
            isn&rsquo;t self-explanatory. For example, 
            <q>what does this 18px come from?</q>
          </li>
        </ol>
