  <p>Grade Seven Mathematics is the standard mathematics course taken by students in
    their second year of secondary education. Students who successfully complete the
    <a rel="external"
    href="http://doe.virginia.gov/testing/sol/standards_docs/mathematics/index.shtml">
    Grade Seven Standards of Learning</a>
    should prepare to study <a>Algebra I</a> in eighth grade. Students who need reinforcing of
    mathematical abilities before Algebra I should prepare to enroll in
    <a>Grade Eight Mathematics</a>.</p>
  <p>Please see the <a href="pacingguide.html">Pacing Guide</a> for
    more information about the curriculum.</p>

<section id="grading">
  <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
  <p>Students&rsquo; grades for each marking period in Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s class are
    categorized as follows:</p>
  <dl class="o-FlexContainer map-grades">
    <dt class="u-w_p3">Benchmark Exam</dt>     <dd class="u-w_p3c">15%</dd>
    <dt class="u-w_p3">Projects</dt>           <dd class="u-w_p3c">10%</dd>
    <dt class="u-w_p3">Tests</dt>              <dd class="u-w_p3c">30%</dd>
    <dt class="u-w_p3">Quizzes</dt>            <dd class="u-w_p3c">25%</dd>
    <dt class="u-w_p3">Homework/Classwork</dt> <dd class="u-w_p3c">20%</dd>
  </dl>
  <section id="categories">
    <section id="cat-exam" class="cat-exam">
      <p>The Benchmark Exam is an end-of-quarter exam that tests all the material
        that has been covered that quarter, and serves as a predictor of how the student
        will perform on the end-of-course test.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cat-proj" class="cat-proj">
      <p>Projects measure students&rsquo; mathematical abilities and knowledge of
        a general unit. Only the final product is graded, so the process (studying,
        preparation, <i lang="la"><abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr></i>) is not evaluated.
        These grades are based on correctness and
        are judged by a rubric or criterion.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cat-test" class="cat-test">
      <p>Tests measure students&rsquo; performance on learning objectives
        mandated by the State. They are administered to show teacher and students a snapshot
        of their proficiency with the standards. Though tests are mostly graded on correctness,
        the student&rsquo;s progress and level of proficiency is taken into account.
        <strong>Test grades will indicate to the student their level of proficiency with the
          material.</strong></p>
      <p>Students will receive the following indicators for level of achievement on tests:</p>
      <dl class="o-FlexContainer map-grades">
        <dt class="u-w_p3">V</dt>   <dd class="u-w_p3c">mastered</dd>                   <!-- <dd>(100%)</dd> -->
        <dt class="u-w_p3">IV</dt>  <dd class="u-w_p3c">proficient</dd>                 <!-- <dd>(90% or above)</dd> -->
        <dt class="u-w_p3">III</dt> <dd class="u-w_p3c">partially proficient</dd>       <!-- <dd>(80% or above)</dd> -->
        <dt class="u-w_p3">II</dt>  <dd class="u-w_p3c">working towards proficiency</dd><!-- <dd>(70% or above)</dd> -->
        <dt class="u-w_p3">I</dt>   <dd class="u-w_p3c">unsatisfactory</dd>             <!-- <dd>(60% or above)</dd> -->
        <dt class="u-w_p3">O</dt>   <dd class="u-w_p3c">declined</dd>                   <!-- <dd>(50%)</dd> -->
      </dl>
      <p>Students are offered an unlimited number of chances to retake tests
        within each marking period. The student&rsquo;s final test grade will result in a
        weighted average of the two test scores: 30% of the first test score and 70% of
        the retake score. If a student attempts a test multiple times, the final test grade
        is based on the <strong>trend</strong> of the previous attempts. This means that if a
        student does worse on the retake, his/her grade may lower. Students may not
        retake tests from previous marking periods.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cat-quiz" class="cat-quiz">
      <p>Quizzes act as stepping-stones to tests. They are open-book and
        very short, measuring students&rsquo; understanding of specific concepts. Notes
        and homework may be used during these quizzes, so students who study and practice
        nightly will benefit.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="cat-hw" class="cat-hw">
      <p>Homework, classwork, and in-class activities help teacher and students
        obtain a view of the progress they are making towards understanding a topic.
        They are graded only on completion and participation, assuming there is evidence of
        a reasonable effort. See <a href="#homework">Homework Policy</a> below.</p>

    <h3>Make-Up Work Policy</h3>
    <p>Students needing to make up work should follow the steps below to catch up
      on what they missed:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, check Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s website and/or online calendar.</li>
      <li>If #1 fails, ask a classmate.</li>
      <li>If #2 fails, email Mr. Harvey</li>
      <li>If all else fails, please see Mr. Harvey in school, during Lunch or Soar.</li>

  <section id="homework">
    <h3>Homework Policy</h3>
    <p>Students will be given homework on a daily basis. Homework assignments
      are expected to be complete by the due date, however students are permitted more time
      if needed. Only homework that is complete may be used for
      <a href="#cat-quiz">Quizzes</a>, which are open-book.</p>
    <p>Each student&rsquo;s homework progress will be recorded in their personal
      homework log, which will be kept at school. When a student receives credit for
      homework, Mr. Harvey will stamp the homework log for that item. Mr. Harvey will
      collect the homework log at the end of the unit, at which point the students&rsquo;
      score will be entered in the grade book. Homework will not be accepted after the
      homework log for that unit is collected.</p>
    <p>It is the student&rsquo;s responsibility to keep track of his or her
      homework progress and make up missing homework accordingly. Parents who wish to be
      kept in the loop on their child&rsquo;s homework progress may make special
      arrangements with Mr. Harvey.</p>
