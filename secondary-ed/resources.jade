            another site includes definitions and examples. This site also explains
            <strong>common mistakes</strong> that students make regarding these rules.
          li.
            Radicals (roots) are the inverses of powers, and logarithms are the
            inverses of exponents. Here&rsquo;s a site with general

            Not only does it group the formulas into categories, but it provides a
            proof of a few identites! So you can use this page to help remember your trig identities,
            and if you&rsquo;re extra ambitious, you can learn <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> some
            of them work!

            Ever wonder how you would graph a complex function? Well, you can&rsquo;t.
            We would need to live in a four-dimensional world to see such a graph. However, you may
            be able to see

            Conceived as a class
            assignment, I was required to journal my reactions to research in math education. I
            thought it was a good idea to keep up with the blog, so you might find a new post
            every now and again.
