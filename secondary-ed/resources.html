  <h2>General Computation, Number Sense, and Math Appreciation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This web page is a <a rel="external"
      href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">graphing calculator</a>. Enter the function,
      see what it looks like, and manipulate it. Click the examples link in the
      upper-right-hand corner to get started.</li>
    <li>Just how small can small be? How big is big? <a rel="external"
      href="http://htwins.net/scale2/">This app</a> shows you just how narrow our everyday
      perception of size can be.</p>

  <h2>Exponent, Radical, and Logarithmic Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Check out my <a>YouTube playlist</a> of exponent rules!</li>
    <li>This site lists the <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.purplemath.com/modules/exponent.htm">basic rules of exponents</a>, and
      includes practice problems.</li>
    <li>For <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/r/radical_rules.htm">rules involving
      radicals</a>, another site includes definitions and examples. This site also explains
      <strong>common mistakes</strong> that students make regarding these rules.</li>
    <li>Radicals (roots) are the inverses of powers, and logarithms are the
      inverses of exponents. Here&rsquo;s a site with general <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.sosmath.com/algebra/logs/log4/log44/log44.html">logarithm rules</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section id="trig">
  <h2>Trigonometric Identities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This resource is a web site full of cool diagrams and explanations of the
      <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.themathpage.com/atrig/trigonometric-identities.htm">Trigonometric
      Identities</a>. Not only does it group the formulas into categories, but it provides a
      proof of a few identites! So you can use this page to help remember your trig identities,
      and if you&rsquo;re extra ambitious, you can learn <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> some
      of them work!</li>
    <li>Another website with proofs of more <a rel="external"
      href="http://oakroadsystems.com/twt/">complicated Trig Idens</a>. This site makes
      connections to harder concepts such as Euler&rsquo;s Formula, complex numbers, and
      polar coordinates. If you think you can take the heat, take a peek!</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section id="calculus">
  <h2>Calculus Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This small Web page contains basic <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/prime/articles/dif_rule/index.asp">differentiation rules</a>,
      in addition to derivatives of exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and inverse
      trigonometric functions. Don&rsquo;t forget to use the <a rel="external"
      href="http://zweigmedia.com/RealWorld/proofs/chainruleproof.html">chain rule</a>!</li>
    <li>This is a large <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.integral-table.com/">table of integrals</a> with every form you can
      possibly think of. There are no proofs included.</li>
    <li>Here are some  <a rel="external"
      href="http://2000clicks.com/MathHelp/CalculusIntegralTableOfIntegrals.aspx">proofs of
      basic integrals</a>.</li>
    <li><a rel="external" href="http://calculusapplets.com/">Calculus
      Applets</a> has 78 different interactive applets useful for reviewing topics in calculus.
      They are also great for lesson plans.</li>
    <li>Like most students, you may have difficulty interpreting the
      <a rel="external"
      href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/visual.calculus/4/ftc.9/">Fundamental Theorem of
      Calculus</a>. What does it actually say? Check out these comprehensive and visually
      interactive examples, applications, and proofs of the Theorem.</li>
    <li>What&rsquo;s the <span class="M">dx</span> for, anyway? Find out
      all about <a rel="external"
      href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/kenny/papers/dx.html">differentials
      (infinitessimals)</a> and what they actually mean.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="analysis">
  <h2>Real and Complex Analysis</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ever wonder how you would graph a complex function? Well, you can&rsquo;t.
      We would need to live in a four-dimensional world to see such a graph. However, you may
      be able to see <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/java/Complex.html">one or a few points at a time</a>
      to get a brief picture.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="stat">
  <h2>Statistics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This <a rel="external"
      href="http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/z_table.html">normal distribution calculator</a>
      finds the area under any normal distribution between two bounds, including infinite
      bounds. Use this tool in case you don&rsquo;t have your <a
      href="../higher-ed/math-4644/technology/handhelds/graphcalcs.html">graphing calculator</a> with you.</li>

  <h2>Readings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Check out <a rel="external"
      href="http://www.math-ed-research.blogspot.com/">my blog</a>! Conceived as a class
      assignment, I was required to journal my reactions to research in math education. I
      thought it was a good idea to keep up with the blog, so you might find a new post
      every now and again.</li>
