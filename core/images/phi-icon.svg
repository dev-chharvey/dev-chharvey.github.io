How to construct the phi icon using GSP:
 1. Construct a line segment AB.
 2. Construct a point C such that BC:CA forms the golden proportion (about 161.8%).
 3. Construct circle CA.
 4. Construct line m through C such that the angle between line m and line AB form a 72 degree angle (1/5 of 360). Do this using a pentagon or whatever.
 5. Construct point D on line m such that CA is congruent to CD.
 6. Construct a point K on segment CD such that CK:DK forms the golden proportion. Then construct a point E on the other side of C such that CE is congruent to CK.
 7. Construct segments BD, DA, and AE.
 8. Construct the angle bisector n of angle BCD.
 9. Construct intersection F of line n and segment BD and intersection G of line n and segment AE.
 10. Hide everything except points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, and segments AB, DE, BD, DA, AE, and FG.


Theorems:
 1. CA and CD are congruent, which makes triangle CDA isosceles.
 2. BC and BD are congruent, which makes triangle BCD isosceles.
 3. DE and DA are congruent, which makes triangle ADE isosceles.
 4. DA and DB are congruent, which makes triangle ADB isosceles.
 5. AC and AE are congruent, which makes triangle ACE isosceles.
 6. CG and CE are congruent, which makes triangle CGE isosceles.
 7. CD and CF are congruent, which makes triangle CGE isosceles.
 8. DA is parallel to FG.
 9. DB is parallel to AE.


Given a line segment AB, construct the golden proportion, with a point C closer to, arbitrarily, A:
 1. Construct a line l perpendicular to AB at point A.
 2. Construct the midpoint M of AB.
 3. Construct circle AM.
 4. Construct an intersection I of circle AM with line l.
 5. Construct circle IA.
 6. Construct line segment IB.
 7. Construct the intersection J of circle IA with segment IB.
 8. Construct circle BJ.
 9. Construct intersection C of circle BJ with segment AB.
 10. Hide everything except points A, B, C, and segment AB.
 11. The ratio of BC to AB forms the golden ratio.
